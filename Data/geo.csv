The officials said that the explosion was carried out near a police mobile van near Ring Road's Mandi, leaving two cops martyred and three others wounded. The Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Operations confirmed that it was a suicide attack that targeted the police vehicle. The country witnessed a sharp increase in terror attacks in January 2025, surging by 42% compared to the previous month, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), a think tank. The data revealed that at least 74 militant attacks were recorded nationwide, resulting in 91 fatalities, including 35 security personnel, 20 civilians, and 36 militants. Another 117 individuals sustained injuries, including 53 security forces personnel, 54 civilians, and 10 militants. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) remained the worst-affected province, followed by Balochistan. In KP’s settled districts, militants carried out 27 attacks, resulting in 19 fatalities, including 11 security personnel, six civilians, and two militants.

Indian journalist admits reporting fake news on live TV,"May 10, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603894-indian-journalist-admits-reporting-fake-news-on-live-tv,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-10/603894_53529_updates.jpg,"As clashes flared between the Indian and Pakistani forces, New Delhi was slammed by experts, veteran Indian journalists and celebrities for the overwhelming spread of fake news about the events that unfolded. While India has not commented on the matter, an incident that occurred live on a prominent Indian news channel, NDTV, cast a shadow over the Indian media coverage of the clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Earlier today, hours, after Pakistan launched its offensive against India, named Bunyan-um-Marsoos, an Indian reporter, made a startling ""slip-of-tongue"" during a live television broadcast. The reporter, who had joined the channel via video, accidentally confessed to reporting fake news during the span of the clashes. He stated that their superiors pressured them to give updates and, after airing fake news, they questioned reporters over it. ""First, they say, 'Give us an update! give us an update! then they air the fake news and ask us why we reported fake news,"" the visibly frustrated reporter said. The reporter concluded his remark with some inappropriate words and seemed to have been unaware that his microphone was switched on. This admission provides stark evidence of the misinformation being disseminated by the Indian media during a highly sensitive and volatile conflict."

The S-400 system, valued at around $1.5 billion, was considered one of India’s most advanced defence assets. In another major strike, a key Indian Military Intelligence training centre in Rajouri, involved in planning terrorist activities in Pakistan, has also been neutralised. Through Indian media reports, India’s Sirsa Airfield — a critical military base — has been damaged. Pakistani drones were spotted flying over Gujarat, the home state of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, triggering serious concern in the area. The latest escalation in the decades-old Pakistan-India rivalry began on May 7 when at least 31 civilians, including children, were killed in an unprovoked Indian cross-border attack. In retaliation, Pakistan downed five IAF fighter jets, including three Rafale, and dozens of drones. During the escalation, India sent drones into Pakistani territory, with the military shooting down nearly 80, including Israeli-made IAI Heron — medium-altitude, long-endurance — unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Earlier on Friday night, India launched multiple missile attacks on Pakistani airbases, including the Noor Khan, Murid, and Shorkot airbases, which were fired from aircraft, according to Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR), Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry. In response, Pakistan said it launched a military operation against India early on Saturday, targeting multiple military bases, including a missile storage site in northern India, as the neighbours extended their worst fighting in nearly three decades. Subsequently, President Donald Trump said on Saturday that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a fourth day of strikes and counter-strikes against each other's military installations. ""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social."

Robertson, while taking to CNN today, cited a source who was present during high-level negotiations, revealing that Pakistan was sort of on a ""military pause"" to give a window for diplomacy. ""What I understand from this source is that that was blown out of the window when India attacked three airbases,"" he added. In response, the journalist added, Pakistan unleashed its full military capability, prompting New Delhi to seek immediate mediation through US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Saudi Arabia, and Turkish officials. Despite multiple flare-ups throughout the day, he said the ceasefire was finally brokered after intense international diplomatic pressure. ""The ceasefire was described by sources as a now or never moment,"" he added. The CNN journalist also noted that water rights remain a critical issue for Pakistan moving forward. ""The key issue for Pakistan going forward is water,"" Robertson said, quoting a source. ""But for now, this is a ceasefire — everything will work out from there."""

""Pakistan made it clear that the negotiations, which ought to take place at a table, would now be held on the battlefield,"" the premier said while addressing the nation on Saturday night.

""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Taking the nation into confidence on regional security today, PM Shehbaz said that considering the regional peace and the lives of millions of people living in this region, Pakistan, as a responsible state, gave a positive response to a ceasefire. He expressed the hope that all the outstanding issues, including the water distribution, the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and all other unresolved issues, would now be settled by holding negotiations and by adopting a peaceful path. The prime minister congratulated the entire nation from the core of his heart that they proved to the world their self-esteem and respect, which were dearer to them than their lives, adding, “If anyone challenges the sovereignty, they stand like an iron wall and overpower their enemies.” “What the enemy did was a cowardly and shameful act, a naked aggression,” but the brave and bold forces, with a display of professionalism, gave a very effective response which would always be remembered as a chapter in modern warfare. He said on the pretext of the Pahalgam incident, India tried to drag Pakistan into a war, even though, without any delay, they had offered cooperation for an impartial and transparent global probe. In the face of a flurry of false allegations and accusations, Pakistan showed restraint and patience, he said, adding India tried to infiltrate territories with drones and missile attacks upon innocent people, mosques and civilians besides, tried their patience with botched attacks on military installations and water resources. He commended the armed forces of Pakistan, whose Jawans were alien to the word of ‘defeat’. Within a few hours, he said their forces silenced the enemy’s guns and the world would remember how they turned the enemy’s air bases, installations and stockpiles into ashes. ""Rafale also failed in the encounter.” The prime minister said that their fight was against that old mind frame of religious bigotry. “It is a victory for truth and our principles,” he said, adding that they did to an enemy what deemed fit by a respected nation. ""The 240 million people of the country showered their love and affection upon their valiant armed forces and stood side by side with them during the conflict,"" he added. He also thanked the nation for their prayers for the success of their armed forces and said that as a result, Allah Almighty had bestowed upon them a tremendous victory. On this historic victory, he paid tribute to Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu, Naval Chief Admiral Naveed Ashraf and every officer and personnel of the armed forces. The prime minister expressed gratitude to General Syed Asim Munir, on his behalf and on behalf of the entire nation, for his sagacious and bold leadership that led to victory, besides appreciating the Air Chief and his eagles who had made them proud. The prime minister thanked US President Trump for his sincere role in the ceasefire. He also thanked the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, Qatar, the UK, UN Secretary General and others who played their due role in the ceasefire. The premier especially mentioned Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Mohamed bin Zayed, Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad and President Tayyip Erdogan, who stood with Pakistan like brothers. He expressed gratitude to the Chinese leadership, including President Xi Jinping and the Chinese people, for their unprecedented and historic support. The prime minister also remembered Irtaza Abbas Shaheed, who embraced shahadat during the Indian aggression and expressed sympathies with the bereaved families who lost their members. The prime minister thanked all the allied and opposition parties and the entire political leadership and parliament for their unprecedented unity and solidarity, and also mentioned his leader, Nawaz Sharif for his wise leadership and experience, besides President Asif Ali Zardari for his valuable consultations. The prime minister appreciated the mediapersons and social media users who had countered Indian fake news with responsible reporting and display of professional integrity and hoped that the set precedent would be a guiding path in the future. Expressing his firm belief, he said after overcoming this crisis, all the governments and institutions would focus their energies on the progress and prosperity of Pakistan and would not rest till the country carves a niche among the comity of nations."
India's strategy crumbled against Pakistan's composure: Khawaja Asif,"May 11, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603985-indias-strategy-crumbled-against-pakistans-composure-khawaja-asif,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-11/603985_2691309_updates.jpg,"Following a US-brokered ceasefire understanding between nuclear-armed Pakistan and India, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Saturday that India expected a weak response, but its strategy crumbled before Pakistan’s calm and calculated response. “The myth of Indian’s arrogance has vanished into thin air,” he said, adding that India thought that it would bring Pakistan to the negotiating table on their own terms through military aggression. Speaking of dialogue, he stated that matters related to the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), terrorism and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) would be discussed in potential talks with New Delhi. His remarks came after reports started circulating on social and mainstream media that IWT — a key water-sharing pact between India and Pakistan — will remain suspended, despite the countries reaching a ceasefire agreement. The IWT, mediated by the World Bank in 1960, regulates the division of water from the Indus River and its tributaries between the South Asian nations. India pulled out of it last month after a deadly attack targeting tourists in Pahalgam, (IIOJK). India accused Pakistan of being involved in the attack, while  Islamabad denied its involvement in the violence and had said it was preparing international legal action over the suspension of the treaty, which ensures water for 80% of its farms. Speaking on Geo News today, the defence minister said: “These are the three major issues [IWT, terrorism and Kashmir] that can be discussed as of now.” He said, probably, India was not expecting such a response from Islamabad as the armed forces of Pakistan stunned the Indian forces in the four-day clashes. The latest escalation in the decades-old Pakistan-India rivalry began on May 7 when at least 31 civilians, including children, were killed in an unprovoked Indian cross-border attack. In retaliation, Pakistan downed five IAF fighter jets, including three Rafale, and dozens of drones. During the escalation, India sent drones into Pakistani territory, with the military shooting down nearly 80, including Israeli-made IAI Heron — medium-altitude, long-endurance — unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In the wee hours of Saturday, the Pakistan army launched ""Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos"", targeting multiple Indian military installations, according to security sources. Referring to India’s defeat during the recent clashes, the defence czar said Pakistan had dispelled Indian misconceptions about power. “India was gripped by the hubris of power, but its arrogance has collapsed in the face of Pakistan’s composed and strategic response,” the minister added. Responding to a question, the minister said that Islamabad repeatedly asked New Delhi to provide evidence in support of their allegation against Pakistan in the backdrop of the Pahalgam. Instead of providing evidence, India attacked Pakistan, he said, adding that New Delhi’s credibility had come into question due to its behaviour. The minister said that the international community appreciated Pakistan’s stance on the matter. He emphasised that Pakistan maintained restraint throughout the episode, kept its threshold low, and prioritised peace without compromising its presence or security. “India’s military and diplomatic assessments have been proven wrong. Their narrative has found no acceptance globally due to their failure to provide evidence or allow impartial investigation,” he said. He further said that India failed to secure backing from a single country. “We hope India, and particularly its leadership, will one day prioritise the region’s future over party interests. Peaceful coexistence based on equality is key to South Asia’s progress,” he added. — With additional input from APP."
"India caught off guard by Pakistan's hardware, technical edge: UK expert","May 11, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/604012-india-caught-off-guard-by-pakistans-hardware-technical-edge-uk-expert,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-11/604012_3080773_updates.jpeg,"British security and defence analyst Professor Michael Clarke remarked on Saturday that Pakistan may have caught India off guard with the strength of its military hardware and technical capabilities, The News reported, citing Sky News . In an interview with British news outlet, Clarke stated that India would likely view Pakistan’s display of strength as a sign of risk-taking. “The Indians might have been surprised by the hardware that the Pakistanis brought to bear,” he said, “because as we’re now discovering they’ve used quite a lot of their Chinese-based technology, and the attention at the moment is focused on the J-10 fighter.” Clarke added that it appeared one of Pakistan’s J-10 jets may have downed a Rafale, one of the French-made fighter aircraft in India’s arsenal. “And undoubtedly,” he continued, “the Pakistanis have used their HQ-9, anti-aircraft missiles, which again may have been rather effective.” “So I think the Indians might have been surprised by the technical abilities that Pakistan seems to have absorbed with their Chinese equipment, but they won’t have been surprised by the bellicosity of [Gen Asim] Munir because they rather expected that,” he further added. He also said that partly, India’s response has been to try to, as it were, teach (Gen) Munir a lesson that they really are prepared to do whatever it takes, and indeed they’ve deployed a carrier battle group of their Western fleet. “It’s sitting only 300 miles off Karachi, which is a sort of threat to go in for a more general war, unless the Pakistanis found a way of backing down from this position. Unfortunately, the international community has given them a line that they can both top out at.” He said both sides have agreed to a ceasefire which has been pushed so hard and, to its credit, by the Trump administration and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. However, he said, they (the US administration) were rather late in getting on this, as this thing had been going on since Tuesday but now it seems their words have made a difference. US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a fourth day of strikes and counter-strikes against each other's military installations. Pakistan's foreign minister also said both countries had agreed to a ceasefire ""with immediate effect"" and India's foreign ministry said it would start at 5pm Indian time (1130 GMT). The latest escalation in the decades-old Pakistan-India rivalry began on May 7 when at least 31 civilians were killed in an unprovoked Indian cross-border attack. In retaliation, Pakistan downed five IAF fighter jets, including three Rafale, and dozens of drones. Shortly after the attack on the Pakistani airbases in the wee hours of Saturday, the Pakistan army launched its counter-attack in direct response to continuous provocations by India. In a major success for the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), hypersonic missiles fired by JF-17 Thunders destroyed India's S-400 system at Adampur airbase, security sources said. The airbase was also hit during the strike. The S-400 air defence system is worth around $1.5 billion, considered India’s most advanced air defence shield."

According to aviation sources, dozens of flights remained in limbo. On Sunday alone, 45 flights from Karachi (including 39 international), 38 from Lahore (including 32 international), 40 from Islamabad (including 36 international), 11 from Peshawar, 10 from Multan, and 6 from Sialkot were cancelled, as per the official flight schedule. In contrast, over 25 flights operated from Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Multan, Faisalabad, and Quetta. Major foreign carriers have cancelled around 125 inbound and outbound flights, causing widespread disruption for international travellers. Many flights between Karachi and Lahore or Islamabad are being rerouted via Quetta due to the closure of the Rahim Yar Khan flight corridor. According to a Notam issued by aviation authorities, Rahim Yar Khan’s air route will remain closed until 5am on May 18. Flights from Gulf countries to cities like Lahore, Multan, and Faisalabad are now facing longer durations due to detours. The airport was partially damaged in an Indian airstrike on Friday. Meanwhile, efforts to sustain the ongoing Hajj operations are being made by various airlines, which are working to ensure continuity despite operational challenges at major airports. The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) had announced on Saturday that the country’s airspace had been fully reopened for all categories of flights. The announcement followed US President Donald Trump’s declaration that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire after Pakistan's military response to Indian aggression. Trump said that Pakistan and India had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a fourth day of strikes and counter-strikes against each other's military installations. Pakistan's foreign minister also said both countries had agreed to a ceasefire ""with immediate effect"" and India's foreign ministry said it would start at 5pm Indian time (1130 GMT). While airports across the country resumed normal operations, a PAA spokesperson advised travellers to stay in contact with their respective airlines for updates on revised flight schedules. The airspace had previously been closed amid escalating tensions at the Line of Control (LoC), with an extension in effect until noon on May 11 before Saturday’s sudden reversal.

"Trump ready to help Pakistan, India resolve Kashmir dispute after days of tension","May 11, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/604024-trump-ready-to-help-pakistan-india-resolve-kashmir-dispute-after-days-of-tension,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-11/604024_5270788_updates.jpg,"A fragile ceasefire was holding between Pakistan and India on Sunday, after hours of overnight fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as US President Donald Trump said he would work to provide a solution regarding Kashmir. The two countries, born out of British colonial rule in 1947, have gone to war three times — twice over the region of Kashmir. Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule parts of Kashmir but claim it in full. New Delhi blames Islamabad for an insurgency in IIOJK that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also claims Pakistan-based groups for attacks elsewhere in India — a claim consistently rejected by the government in Islamabad. Pakistan says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people. Recently, the arch rivals were involved in intense firing for four days, the worst in nearly three decades, with missiles and drones being fired at each other's military installations and dozens of people killed. A ceasefire agreement was reached after diplomacy and pressure from the United States, but within hours, artillery fire was witnessed in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), the centre of much of the fighting. Blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities near the border under blackout, similar to the previous two evenings, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses. Late on Saturday, India had violated the understanding reached to stop firing. In response, Pakistan said it was committed to the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations. By dawn, the fighting and explosions reported overnight had died down on both sides of the border, according to Reuters witnesses. Power was restored in most areas along India's border towns after a blackout the previous night. Trump praised leaders of both countries for agreeing to halt the aggression. ""While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great nations. Additionally, I will work with you both to see if... a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. In the border city of Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs, a siren sounded in the morning to resume normal activities brought a sense of relief and people were seen out on the roads. The fighting started on Wednesday, two weeks after 26 men were killed in an attack targeting Hindus in IIOJK’s Pahalgam. ""Ever since the day terrorists attacked people in Pahalgam we have been shutting our shops very early and there was an uncertainty. I am happy that at least there will be no bloodshed on both sides,"" Satvir Singh Alhuwalia, 48, a shopkeeper in Amritsar told Reuters . Officials in Pakistan said there was some firing in Bhimber in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) overnight but nowhere else, and there were no casualties. The combined death toll in the recent skirmishes has reached nearly 70, officials have said. ""More than me, my family is happy because my children and wife have been calling me every hour to check on me. Thank God the ceasefire happened,"" Guruman Singh, a security guard in Amritsar told Reuters ."

According to a statement issued by the Media Wing of the Prime Minister’s Office, the PM said the 'Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos' gave an effective and befitting response to the enemy’s aggression, adding that the country proved its superiority at every front. He said that despite India’s aggression, Pakistan maintained its defence with resilience and demonstrated full readiness to deal with the situation. The premier urged the nation and the Ulema (religious scholars) to offer collective prayers and Nawafils across the country as an expression of gratitude to Allah Almighty. He called for holding special prayers for the blessings of martyrs and Ghazis, saying that the sacrifices of the Pakistani armed forces could never be forgotten. The nation stands by their side, he added. The development came following US President Donald Trump’s declaration that Pakistan and India had agreed to a ceasefire after Pakistan's military response to Indian aggression. Recently, the arch rivals were involved in intense firing for four days, the worst in nearly three decades, with missiles and drones being fired at each other's military installations. A ceasefire agreement was reached after diplomacy and pressure from the United States and several other countries.

Chasing a modest target of 143, the Kings fell short, finishing at 137-8 despite a promising start. The innings began on a shaky note as Karachi captain David Warner was dismissed for just four runs by Mohammad Amir in the opening over. Tim Seifert and James Vince launched a counterattack, taking an aggressive approach to put the Gladiators under pressure. The duo built a 50-run stand for the second wicket, consistently finding boundaries and appearing in control. However, the momentum shifted when Quetta skipper Saud Shakeel broke the partnership by dismissing Vince for 30 off 29 balls, with the Kings at 77-2 in the ninth over. Seifert continued his assault but was removed by Mohammad Wasim Jr. for a blistering 47 off 26 deliveries, reducing Karachi to 93-3 in the 12th over. Karachi’s middle order faltered under pressure. Shan Masood's struggles continued as he was dismissed by Khurram Shahzad for a laborious 9 off 17 balls. The situation worsened when Abrar Ahmed removed Khushdil Shah for a duck, and Amir returned to dismiss Mohammad Nabi for four. Shahzad struck again to send Abbas Afridi back without scoring, and Wasim Jr. further dented Karachi’s hopes by removing Omair Bin Yousuf for 11. Despite a fighting 24* off 13 balls from Hasan Ali, the Kings couldn’t reach the target, falling short by five runs. Earlier, batting first, Quetta Gladiators endured a shaky start. Captain Saud Shakeel fell early to Hasan Ali, while Mohammad Nabi removed Mark Chapman to leave Quetta at 44-4 by the end of the powerplay. Kusal Mendis offered brief resistance with a quickfire 36 off 22 balls, including five boundaries, but his stay was cut short by Abbas Afridi in the ninth over. He and Hassan Nawaz had added a crucial 25-run stand. Nawaz, along with Faheem Ashraf, attempted to steady the innings with a 59-run partnership for the sixth wicket. Nawaz scored 35 off 34 before being dismissed by Fawad Ali, who claimed his maiden PSL wicket. Faheem provided a late boost with a vital 43 off 26 balls before falling to Abbas Afridi. Quetta’s innings concluded at 139 in 19.3 overs after Khurram Shahzad was run out by Hasan Ali, assisted by Tim Seifert. For Karachi, Hasan Ali led the bowling attack with three wickets. Abbas Afridi and Mir Hamza took two apiece, while Mohammad Nabi and Fawad Ali chipped in with one wicket each."

Addressing the media outside the agency's office, the model said she had ""provided all the information to the FIA officials regarding the fake call"". The apology come after the FIA launched investigations against the actor under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) for allegedly levelling baseless allegations against the probe agency. Nadia had taken to her Instagram account and claimed that a man impersonating an FIA officer attempted to defraud her. A post shared by Nadia Hussain Khan (@nadiahussain_khan) The incident occurred days after the arrest of the actor's husband in a financial embezzlement case. The FIA arrested the actor's husband, Atif Khan, in the multi-million fraud case last week and he is currently under investigation. The actor said that an alleged ""FIA officer"" demanded a Rs30 million bribe for her husband's bail. According to Nadia, the caller asked her that the matter should remain between the two of them. The actor said that initially, she almost believed him, however, it didn’t take her much time to recognise the whole situation. She further stated today that right after she received the fraudulent call, she filed a complaint on the FIA's portal but she was unaware that a written complaint was also required. Hussain further revealed that the suspect only contacted her ""via WhatsApp"". The model also requested ""higher authorities to save people from fraudsters"" and proposed that the institutions and her should collaborate on an awareness video. The actor also advised the public to not be afraid and to file complaints against the such individuals."

The controversy erupted during a recent Ramadan transmission on a TV channel, featuring the actor. As he shared his views on personal issues, Taimoor also remarked that a man has the right to marry four women. ""The permission to men for four marriages has been granted, but I am not doing it yet, that’s a different story,"" the actor shared with the audience, with his wife sitting in front of him. He continued: ""I say this in front of her [Ayeza Khan] and today I’m saying it in front of you all, I am allowed to marry four times […] but it’s because of my love and respect for her, that for now [filhal], I want to spend my life with her.""

""I know all of you are a bit upset with me. Whatever happened on that day, some people think that I disrespected my wife. However, that's definitely not the case,"" he clarified. The actor insisted that this was never his intention and he loves Ayeza a lot. ""Maybe, the words that I used were not right. I just want to stress that the word 'filhal [for now]' is a word that I often use in my daily life because I believe that we are not in this world forever."" ""We talk about the present, which is 'filhal (for now)' and I especially speak about that. Maybe I should not have used that word, maybe it was a slip of tongue, or whatever it was."" ""It's been 18 years now and I have not been involved in any controversy and I'd like to keep it that way by finishing this issue right now. Because it was not my intention nor was such a thought in my heart."" Still, he said, if people think that they were hurt, ""maybe I said something that they did not like, I wholeheartedly apologise"". ""Believe me, I do not want you guys [fans] to be upset with me as I am here to entertain you guys. I have dedicated my life to entertaining people and making them happy.

Taking to his Instagram account, Zafar shared his video and wrote: “A humble effort, crafted with love and deep respect for our beloved Prophet (PBUH).” His video garnered over 2,000 views on YouTube within one hour. A post shared by Ali Zafar (@ali_zafar) It is said that the Qaseeda was written by Imam al-Busiri in a state of a powerful tribulation, when he woke up one day to find himself partially paralysed and all experts failed to cure him. Prior to this, he was a famous poet in Cairo, who was widely recognised by the rich and powerful of his society. However, due to his condition, the man whose erudition and art had elevated him to the status of the prince of poets — was reduced to an invalid. During that time he wrote the Qaseeda in his ceaseless admiration for the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), with the belief that the humanity’s salvation lay in calling upon His magnanimity and compassion in front of Allah. One night, in a state of intercession with the Creator while reciting this Qaseeda, weeping, praying and imploring for forgiveness, he dozed off and something miraculous happened. The Imam was granted the audience of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), who approved of the Qaseeda and put His mantle (burda/chaddar) on the paralysed part of Imam’s body. The following morning, he found himself completely cured and as you can guess, the ode later became known as the Qaseeda Burda. The legacy of Burdah Shareef 800 years later today, is still a shining example of how a prayer uttered with humility and remorse has the power to potentially change the most challenging of the situations in miraculous ways."

The prestigious squad includes players from three other countries — West Indies, Bangladesh, and Scotland — alongside Pakistan on the basis of their exceptional performances during the tournament. Pakistan’s captain, Sana, played a pivotal role in her team’s campaign, contributing both with the bat and the ball. Sana’s best performance came in a rain-affected match against Scotland, where she claimed 4/23, helping derail Scotland's innings. Pakistan eventually won that encounter by six wickets. In addition to her bowling, she was instrumental with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 62 against Thailand in a tense chase, showcasing her leadership and resilience under pressure. Muneeba Ali, Pakistan’s reliable opening batter, was another standout performer. Her solid starts were crucial in laying a strong foundation for the team throughout the tournament. Ali’s best knock came against Scotland, where she scored 71 runs off nearly a ball per run, anchoring Pakistan’s chase of 187 and ensuring a comfortable win. Nashra Sandhu was one of the tournament’s most consistent bowlers, claiming 10 wickets at an average of 15.60. Sandhu’s control and guile with the ball were key to Pakistan's success, and she took vital wickets in the middle overs to keep opposition teams under pressure. Her performance against West Indies, where she dismissed key players, was particularly significant. Alongside Sandhu, Sadia Iqbal was Pakistan’s other major spin threat. Iqbal took nine wickets throughout the tournament, maintaining an economy rate of under four runs per over. Her tight bowling in the middle overs helped Pakistan gain control of matches, with her best performance coming in a match where she claimed 3/28. The Team of the Tournament also includes some standout players from other nations. West Indies' Hayley Matthews was exceptional, finishing as the highest wicket-taker with 13 wickets, including a match-winning 4/24. She also scored an unbeaten 114* against Scotland, leading from the front in both departments. Matthews' all-round performances were a defining factor in her team’s campaign. Kathryn Bryce of Scotland was named Player of the Tournament for her outstanding all-round performances. She topped the run charts with 293 runs, including a brilliant 131* in Scotland’s final match, and also took six wickets. Sharmin Akhter of Bangladesh earned a spot in the team after scoring 266 runs, including a crucial 94* against Thailand. Her consistent performances were vital to Bangladesh’s progress through the tournament.

Following a thorough review, both parties agreed that withdrawing Short from the tournament was in the best interest of his long-term fitness and career. The 27-year-old has since returned to Australia to continue his rehabilitation under CA’s supervision. ""Islamabad United remain fully committed to the well-being of all our players and extend our support to Matt during his recovery,"" the franchise said in a statement.

Chasing a modest 129-run target, United comfortably reached the finish line with 17 balls to spare and six wickets in hand. They got off to a brisk start with Sahibzada Farhan and Azam Khan opening the innings. The pair added 34 runs before Farhan was dismissed by Hasan Ali after a fiery 30 off just 18 balls, including five boundaries and a six. Hasan struck again in the same over, removing Colin Munro for a run-a-ball 4, leaving United at 38/2 in the fifth over. Skipper Shadab Khan then joined Azam Khan at the crease, and the two steadied the innings with a 65-run stand. Their partnership laid the foundation for a comfortable chase before Mohammad Nabi bowled out Azam in the 14th over. Azam contributed a steady 31 from 30 balls, featuring three boundaries and a six, leaving United just 26 runs away from victory, which they eventually achieved with ease. Shadab, on the other hand, had an agonising end to his match-winning knock as he was dismissed by Abbas Afridi in the 17th over when United needed only one run. He remained the top-scorer for the United with a sensible 47 off 40 deliveries, studded with five fours and two sixes. The decisive run was eventually scored on the first delivery of the 18th over by Mohammad Nawaz, who remained unbeaten with eight off 12 balls. Experienced pacer Hasan Ali was once again the standout bowler for the Kings as he picked up two wickets for just 28 runs in his four overs, while Nabi chipped in with one scalp. Earlier, United's bowlers delivered a clinical performance to restrict Karachi Kings to a below-par 128/7. Karachi Kings endured a shaky start as they lost captain David Warner (3) and in-form batter James Vince (4) within the first four overs, managing just 22 runs on the board. Emerging wicketkeeper-batter Saad Baig then joined Tim Seifert in an attempt to stabilise the innings. The pair added 39 runs for the third wicket, playing cautiously against United's disciplined attack. Their brief resistance was broken in the 10th over when Shadab Khan removed Baig for 20 off 17 balls, laced with four boundaries. Seifert couldn’t hold on for long either, departing in the 13th over to Imad Wasim after a sluggish 30 off 37 balls, which included only one boundary. United kept the pressure on, as Shadab returned to dismiss Mohammad Irfan Khan (5 off 8) early in the 16th over, followed by Naseem Shah’s short delivery that undid Khushdil Shah (17 off 23) in the next. Jason Holder, currently the tournament's leading wicket-taker, then removed Aamir Jamal with a sharp bouncer in the 18th over, leaving Kings struggling at 102/7. Abbas Afridi then bolstered the Kings’ total to 128/7 with a quickfire 24-run cameo from just nine deliveries, comprised of one four and three sixes. For United, Naseem, Shadab and Holder led the way with two wickets each, while Imad Wasim chipped in with one scalp. Earlier, Islamabad United won the toss and decided to bowl first against Karachi Kings. Islamabad United remain the only unbeaten side in PSL 10, topping the table with three commanding wins. The defending champions are riding a wave of form and confidence as they look to extend their streak. Karachi Kings, on the other hand, have had a mixed run — opening with a win, stumbling in their second game, and bouncing back with a dominant victory over Quetta Gladiators. Islamabad have dominated this rivalry, winning the last five encounters. Karachi, backed by their home crowd, will aim to break the jinx and turn the tide. Squads Karachi Kings: David Warner, Abbas Afridi and Adam Milne (all platinum), James Vince, Hasan Ali, Khushdil Shah (all diamond), Shan Masood, Muhammad Irfan Khan and Aamir Jamal (all gold), Arafat Minhas (brand ambassador), Tim Seifert, Zahid Mahmood, Mir Hamza (silver), Fawad Ali and Riazullah (both emerging), Omair Bin Yousuf, Saad Baig, Mohammad Nabi and Mirza Mamoon (all supplementary), Ben McDermott.

In an exclusive interview with Geo News , the 29-year-old batsman highlighted that his goal is to secure a stable place in the national side rather than a short-lived opportunity. ""My goal is to play for Pakistan again and stay in the team for the long term, not just for one or two matches,"" Farhan said. ""When I return, I want to cement my place, not just make a brief appearance."" Farhan credited his dominant performances in the recent National T20 Cup, where he smashed three centuries and two fifties, for building his confidence ahead of PSL. ""Scoring a century early in the National T20 gave me a huge boost,"" he said. ""I had planned to dominate that tournament to grab attention for PSL selection, and thankfully, that form has carried forward."" Farhan was initially overlooked by PSL franchises during the players' draft held in January. He then scored 605 runs in 7 innings for the National T20 tournament. His performances backed by three centuries and two half-centuries convinced the United to later pick Sahibzada Farhan in the supplementary category. Farhan said that his consistency in PSL should silence critics who labelled him a ""domestic-only"" performer. ""People used to say I only score in domestic cricket, but I’ve proven them wrong in PSL,"" Farhan said. ""Performing in such a high-profile league makes a strong case for international selection."" Farhan highlighted the importance of PSL performances in easing the transition to international cricket. ""The level of competition here is intense, facing top bowlers in PSL prepares you for the pressures of playing for Pakistan in international cricket,"" he said. ""If you perform here, it becomes easier to adjust at the international level."" He also pointed out the fierce competition for opening slots in Pakistan’s lineup. ""There are many strong openers, so you need consistent performances to earn and retain your spot,"" he said. ""A player shouldn’t be judged after just two or three games; they need a proper run to prove themselves."" Farhan said the support he is getting from the management of the United, particularly the captain Salman Agha, in refining his technique. ""After the first match, Salman gave me valuable tips that helped improve my balance and on-side play,"" he revealed. ""Now I’m scoring more freely in that area."" He also credited his academy coaches for helping him evolve as a batsman. ""Small adjustments can make a big difference, and I’m constantly working to improve,"" he said. Farhan, known for his aggressive stroke play, stressed that he is never content with just a couple of good innings. ""I can’t relax after one or two performances, I always push for more,"" he said. ""My aim is to score at least one or two more centuries this PSL to break the record of most T20 centuries in a calendar year and help my team win."" Reflecting on the challenges of T20 batting, he emphasised the importance of adaptability. ""In T20s, your batting position matters a lot—I prefer opening because it gives me time to build an innings. In ODIs and T20s, you have more time to adjust, but you still need to be proactive."" Farhan admitted that international cricket comes with intense scrutiny but said he is prepared for the challenge. ""There’s a lot of pressure at the highest level, but I’ve learned to embrace it,"" he said. ""My mindset is simple: control what you can, work hard, and let performances speak."" With the United continues to dominate in PSL X, Farhan remains determined to maintain his form. ""I’m enjoying my batting right now, and I want to keep contributing. If I keep performing, the rest will take care of itself."""

The event aimed to recognise and celebrate Aamir’s success as an international artist, her remarkable journey, stellar performances, and contributions to the entertainment industry. Hosted by Labour MP Afzal, the ceremony was attended by Dr Sarah Naseem, wife of Pakistan’s High Commissioner to the UK, along with several prominent figures from the British Pakistani community and media. Afzal praised Aamir, describing her as a major force in the arts and culture sector, deserving of appreciation for both, her talent and humility. After receiving the award, Aamir expressed her gratitude, saying: “It’s an absolute honour to be here. We should continue making Pakistan proud and use our platforms to highlight our country positively. We must remain a strong and united community.” When asked about her work in Bollywood and her collaboration with Diljit Dosanjh, Aamir remained tight-lipped about her current filming commitments in the UK. However, she spoke about the wave of positivity sparked last year when Dosanjh invited her on stage during his London concert. ""That moment created a lot of positivity. Art is art, and whatever the differences — political or otherwise — should not come between humanity and the arts,"" she said. Maria Soraya introduced Aamir as an artist who has broken international boundaries and has been a positive force. She described Aamir as a cultural ambassador and youth icon, saying: “Hania Aamir has revolutionised acting and fashion. She deserves recognition for the way she carries herself.” Aamir jokingly remarked that she had been spending so much time in the UK that she might consider relocating to London. However, she confirmed that she would soon return to Pakistan for Eid to celebrate with her family and friends. Beyond acting, Aamir has made a name for herself in the fashion and brand collaboration industry. She is the most-followed Pakistani celebrity on Instagram and enjoys a significant Indian fanbase. In October last year, she attended Dosanjh’s London concert, where he invited her on stage and serenaded her with his hit song Lover."

They added, “We have always considered you more than just fans — you are family.” Explaining their decision, they said that as parents, it is now their responsibility to protect their children’s privacy and allow them to grow without the pressure of being in the public eye. “Until they reach 18 and choose for themselves whether they wish to be part of the social world, we have decided to keep their lives private,” the couple said. They also requested fans to remember them in their prayers. “We humbly request you to keep our children in your prayers and pray that Allah grants us the strength to raise them in the best way possible,” they added. Ayeza and Danish also made a special appeal to fan pages dedicated to their children. “We deeply appreciate the love you have showered upon them, but we kindly ask you to deactivate these pages as they are not public figures,” they said. The couple thanked the fans once again and said that the love shown to their family will always be remembered.

Regained peak fitness through strict dietary discipline: Hasan Ali,"Apr 21, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/601098-regained-peak-fitness-through-strict-dietary-discipline-hasan-ali,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-04-21/601098_1434209_updates.jpg,"KARACHI: Pakistan fast bowler Hasan Ali has credited a strict dietary discipline and fitness routine for his resurgence in form, saying cutting sugar and fried foods has transformed his energy levels and performance. In an exclusive interview with Geo News, the Karachi Kings vice-captain opened up about the lifestyle changes that helped him regain peak fitness ahead of the ongoing Pakistan Super League (PSL) season. Hasan, 30, revealed he reduced sugar intake by 70% to 80% and minimised oily foods over the past six months. ""In Pakistan, everyone eats fried parathas, and our food has too much oil and sugar,"" he said. “But international athletes focus on organic and fresh foods. I made those adjustments, and the difference is massive, I feel more energetic on the field, and I don’t feel lethargic anymore in my daily routine, I feel fresh."" Hassan was once known for his foodies’ group with several teammates, ""Roti Gang"", when asked if dietary discipline means they’ve disbanded the Roti Gang, Hassan said that won’t happen ever. ""No, the Roti Gang isn’t finished—it’s eternal!"" he quipped. However, he stressed moderation, saying disciplined eating has been key to his improved performance. Hasan attributed his technical improvements to rigorous sessions at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) under the guidance of Pakistan’s coaching staff. “I identified flaws in my bowling, worked on my basics, and modified or remodified a few things,"" he explained. ""Simultaneously, I focused on my diet and injury management, which collectively made a big impact."" His efforts paid off with strong performances in the National T20 Cup and PSL, re-establishing him as a leading fast bowler. The right-arm pacer, who debuted in PSL as an emerging player with Peshawar Zalmi, called the league a ""game-changer"" for Pakistani cricket. ""PSL is a massive brand that has groomed so many players,"" he said. ""Domestic cricket built my foundation, and PSL polished me. Playing alongside and against top international stars from the beginning made my transition to international cricket smoother."" He emphasised the importance of domestic cricket for players out of favour, recalling how he fought his way back into the national team through strong first-class performances. ""When you’re dropped, domestic cricket is your only path back,"" he said. ""I’ve been through that phase, and it’s where you prove yourself again."" As Karachi Kings’ vice-captain, Hasan said he is learning from captain David Warner but is open to leading the side in the future. ""If I’m ever considered for captaincy, I’ll embrace it with both hands,"" he said. ""Right now, I’m gaining valuable experience under Warner’s leadership."" Fans have also noticed a more composed Hasan Ali, who was usually very jolly on and off the field, this season- a shift he attributes to added responsibilities as a senior player and father of two daughters. ""With time, you evolve,"" he said. ""I still enjoy fun moments, but as a senior player and vice-captain, I understand the need for professionalism. Fatherhood has also made me more responsible."" Despite personal milestones, Hasan said team success remains his priority in PSL 10. ""Every player has individual goals, I also want to be the best bowler, but the team’s performance matters most,"" he said. With Pakistan’s next international assignments looming, Hasan aims to carry his PSL form into national duties. ""I’m 30, far from finished,"" he asserted. ""I want to contribute more to Pakistan, but I know selection depends on performance. My job is to keep delivering."""

The investigators ordered her to bring relevant documents of the said case, said FIA officials, adding that Hussain's husband transferred funds worth millions to her bank account, which led to her inclusion in the probe. Sources close to the FIA told Geo News that the embezzled funds had also been circulated in Hussain's business accounts. They added that Hussain's statement will be recorded in the case next week.

It hasn't been long since the American woman made headlines for her dramatic ordeal in Pakistan, where she was left stranded for four months after being dumped by her ""lover"" upon arrival in Karachi. The US citizen had travelled to Karachi in pursuit of love, only to be abandoned by the young man named Nidal Ahmed Memon, a resident of Karachi's Garden area, leaving her stranded in the country. Now, Onijah sat down with BBC Asian Network where she was asked multiple questions about her friendship with Shabana. ""She is very good. She is very funny. She's always on her phone. We've got like similar personalities ... Because in the mornings, we’d be a little fidgety. We were always doing something, but we’d make it on time to where we was going,"" she said. ""Shabana was the type of officer to give me love and compassion. And it was beautiful. She was a woman, add that too. It was a great experience, like, the love was crazy!"" Onijah added. The interviewer then remarked, “You had a team!” referencing to when Onijah called the police officers assigned to her as her team. ""I thought they were behind me on the camera, but I didn’t known that they were stepped to the side. It was a bunch of other officers there, also! It wasn’t just Shabana but Shabana and me grew together, ‘cause she is a woman like me,"" the American woman added. When asked to delve deep into the “funny videos” she had made with Shabana while admitted in the hospital, Onijah again said that the police officer is “really a great person”. “Shabana will love New York,” she added and remarked that the city will be a “great image for her”. Ending the interview, Onijah was asked to give a message to her Pakistani friend and she couldn’t help but send more love for Shabana. “Shabana, I love you,” she said towards the end of her appearance with BBC Asian Network ."
PSL X: Karachi Kings defeat Peshawar Zalmi in low scoring thriller,"Apr 21, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/601106-psl-x-karachi-kings-opt-to-bowl-first-against-peshawar-zalmi,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-04-21/601106_7357753_updates.jpg,"Karachi Kings defeated Peshawar Zalmi by two wickets courtesy of David Warner's half-century and Khushdil Shah's crucial innings of 23 runs in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) 10's low-scoring thriller played at the National Bank Stadium, Karachi, on Monday. Set to chase a modest 148-run target on a challenging surface, the 2020 champions knocked the winning runs on the third delivery of the final over as Hasan Ali smashed Hussain Talat for a boundary on the leg side. The home side, however, got off to the worst possible start to the run chase as their opening batter Tim Seifert fell for a golden duck on the first delivery of the innings, courtesy of a well-crafted in-swinger by Luke Wood. The Kings suffered another blow to their pursuit as Wood struck again in his next over to dismiss his compatriot James Vince, who could score 11 off nine deliveries. Warner then found notable support from the other end in the form of Saad Baig (nine) and the duo forged a crucial 23-run partnership until young Ali Raza got rid of the emerging batter. The skipper was then involved in three important partnerships with Muhammad Irfan Khan (10), Mohammad Nabi (14) and Khushdil Shah before eventually getting dismissed by Wood in the 17th over when Kings needed a further 29 runs from 21 deliveries. Warner remained the top-scorer for the Kings with a 47-ball 60, laced with eight fours. Following his dismissal, the Kings lost two more wickets in quick succession and were eventually reduced to 133/8 in 18.1 overs. But, Khushdil held his nerves calm and guided Kings to a tense victory with an unbeaten 23 off 17 deliveries with the help of three boundaries. Wood was the standout bowler for Zalmi, picking up three wickets for just 28 runs in his four overs, followed by Ali Raza, who claimed two, while Arif Yaqoob and Alzarri Joseph dismissed one batter apiece. Put into bat first on a challenging surface, Zalmi’s batting unit could accumulate 147/8 in their allotted 20 overs despite skipper Babar Azam’s gutsy knock. The visitors got off to a shaky start to their innings as their dynamic opener Saim Ayub walked back in the third over after scoring a mere four. Following the early hiccup, skipper Babar put together a one-sided partnership with Tom Kohler-Cadmore, who could score seven off six deliveries before getting dismissed by Khushdil Shah in the seventh over. The star batter was then involved in another crucial partnership for Zalmi when he added 31 runs for the third wicket with Mohammad Haris before finally falling victim to Khushdil. Babar remained the top-scorer for Zalmi with a 41-ball 46, which featured seven boundaries. Experienced Hussain Talat then joined Haris in the middle and attempted to force recovery. The duo batted sensibly to add 37 runs for the fourth wicket until Talat was outfoxed by Aamir Jamal’s slower delivery and walked back after scoring 18 off 16 deliveries with the help of three boundaries. His dismissal sparked a collapse, which saw Zalmi losing four more wickets in quick succession, including that of their set batter Haris, and were thus eventually reduced to 136/8 in 19 overs. Haris remained a notable run-getter for Zalmi with a 21-ball 28, featuring four boundaries. For Kings, Abbas and Khushdil took three wickets each, while Jamal and Mir Hamza made one scalp apiece. The two-wicket victory helped Karachi Kings to replace Lahore Qalandars to secure second position in the PSL 10 standings as they now have six points after five matches, while Peshawar Zalmi remained fourth. Karachi Kings: Tim Seifert(w), David Warner(c), James Vince, Saad Baig, Khushdil Shah, Irfan Khan, Mohammad Nabi, Aamer Jamal, Abbas Afridi, Hasan Ali and Mir Hamza. Peshawar Zalmi: Babar Azam (c), Saim Ayub, Mohammad Haris (wk), Tom-Kohler Cadmore, Hussain Talat, Mitch Owen, Abdul Samad, Luke Wood, Alzari Joseph, Arif Yaqoob and Ali Raza."

The duo's feat has been widely recognised as unprecedented. Fellow runners applauded their performance, which blended sportsmanship with national identity. Upon their return to Pakistan, the runners plan to hold celebrations to share their milestone with supporters."

Mukaty, a 23-year-old Karachi-based runner who time qualified for the Boston Marathon, clocked an impressive 2:48:47 on the challenging Boston course, known for its punishing Heartbreak Hill segment. ""Heartbreak Hill couldn't break my heart,"" posted Mukaty on his Instagram account. ""The Boston Marathon tested my limits but I rose to the challenge.

The Karachi-based duo was followed by Nizar Nayani, Omer Malik and Sadiq Shah - who ran his 2nd Boston Marathon. The women's contingent was led by 39-year-old Sara Lodhi, who finished in 3:24:46 in what marked her ninth career marathon and fifth World Marathon Major. The UAE-based mother of three gave an emotional account of her journey. ""As a mother of three girls, it's really important to me to model that women can achieve anything they set their mind to,"" Lodhi said. ""They see the discipline - waking up at 3am to train before they're ready for school."" Lodhi added that this is the first generation of Pakistani women running marathons and she's grateful to be part of this movement, ""Qualifying and performing well here has been a humbling journey, Alhamdulillah.""

Elahi, who earned his sixth star in Boston, reflected on the broader meaning of his accomplishment. ""It means the world to me, it's not just an achievement for me personally but it's a tribute to my family especially my parents, wife & kids' support through this journey,"" Elahi said. ""Its representation for Pakistan on a global platform and to our local running community to inspire the younger generation."" USA-based Dr Salman Khan (3:24:45), already a six-star finisher, completed the Boston Marathon for the 5th time. “Seeing all the Pakistani runners in the Boston Marathon is a dream come true for me. With each and every year more and more Pakistanis are representing their country at international venues. This is just wonderful,"" said Dr Salman, who is also playing an important role in bringing all Pakistani-origin runners from around the world under one platform. Additionally, Bokhari, another six-star finisher, said: ""I started running several years ago.  After my sister and I ran our first marathon in Arizona - I set a goal to do the six majors by 2023. Covid had other plans.  It was a way to stay healthy and travel the world."" ""It’s been a tremendous journey. I’m excited about completing the six stars - but I’m even more proud of the growing Pakistani and Muslim running communities,"" she added.

Slater's prison sentence was partly suspended, a registrar at the Maroochydore District Court said. Slater was refused bail by the court just over a year ago after being remanded in police custody and charged with multiple domestic violence offences on Queensland state's Sunshine Coast between December 5, 2023 and April 12, 2024. The charges included allegations of assault, strangulation, burglary and stalking in relation to multiple incidents against a woman in the Noosa region. In sentencing on Tuesday, Maroochydore judge Glen Cash told Slater it was obvious he was an alcoholic, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. ""Your rehabilitation will not be easy — alcoholism is part of your make-up."" Slater played 74 Tests from 1993-2001 and became a successful cricket commentator before being axed by the Seven Network in 2021. He has been charged with multiple domestic violence offences in recent years and struggled with mental health issues.

Chasing a daunting 229-run target, the visitors could only accumulate 195/9 in their allotted overs despite Sikandar Raza’s half-century. The Qalandars got off to a decent start to the pursuit with openers Mohammad Naeem and Fakhar Zaman putting together a brisk 38-run stand. The blazing start was soon hindered as Naeem fell victim to Michael Bracewell in the fourth over after scoring a run-a-ball 11. Fakhar followed suit in the next over as he skied a fuller delivery by Ubaid Shah, which was brilliantly caught by Josh Little in the deep. The opening batter scored 32 off 14 deliveries, laced with two fours and three sixes. The Qalandars then began to lose wickets at regular intervals which halted the flow of the runs for the two-time champions. Wicketkeeper batter Sam Billings offered some resistance in the middle phase of the innings until he was outclassed by Ubaid in the 15th over. He scored 43 off 23 deliveries, smashing two fours and four sixes. Experienced all-rounder Sikandar Raza played a gutsy half-century down the order but his efforts were not enough to pull off the victory for the Qalandars. Raza remained the top-scorer for the Qalandars with an unbeaten 50 off 27 deliveries, comprised of five fours and three sixes. Ubaid was the standout bowler for the Sultans, picking up three wickets for 37 runs in his four overs. He was supported by Bracewell and Usama Mir, who bagged two each, while David Willey and Josh Little chipped in with one strike apiece. Sultans captain Mohammad Rizwan’s decision to bat first paid dividends as his team’s batting unit yielded 228/5 in 20 overs. The home side got off to a blazing start to their innings as their new opening pair of Yasir and Rizwan decimated the Qalandars’ bowlers and scored 89 runs in seven overs. Asif Afridi provided a much-needed breakthrough to the two-time champions on the first delivery of the eighth over when he bowled Rizwan around his leg. The Sultans captain scored a brisk 32 off 17 deliveries with the help of four fours and a six. Wicketkeeper batter Usman Khan then joined set batter Yasir Khan in the middle and together they raised an important 70-run partnership before both perished in successive overs. Usman struck five fours and a six on his way to a 24-ball 39, while Yasir top-scored with a blistering 87 off 44 deliveries, studded with six fours and as many sixes. The 2021 champions suffered another blow in the next over when Rishad Hossain got Ashton Turner (15) caught and brought the total down to 179/4 in 15.4 overs. Later, Iftikhar Ahmed’s brisk 40-run cameo off 18 balls at the backend bolstered Sultans’ total past the 220-run mark. Rishad was the standout bowler for the Qalandars, taking two wickets for 45 runs in his four overs, while Shaheen Shah Afridi, Sikandar Raza and Asif Afridi, chipped in with one scalp apiece."

He also dismissed speculation that he plans to walk away from the team after PSL Season 10. ""I never said I'm abandoning Multan Sultans,"" Tareen told local media during his team's match against the Lahore Qalandars, which the Sultans won by 33 runs. ""We are simply exploring options to re-evaluate our franchise agreement after the tenth edition of the PSL."" Tareen explained that the current financial model is unsustainable for the franchise. ""We do have the option to renew our contract with a 25% increase on the current price. But at that price, we're operating at a loss,"" he said. ""My plan is to exercise our right to exit the current agreement and rebid for the team – hopefully at a more realistic valuation, similar to Karachi Kings' $26 million deal over ten years."" He also pointed to the challenges faced by the franchise's previous owners. ""They suffered significant losses and couldn't continue. We stepped in, and now we'll look to bid again under better terms."" Commenting on his team's recent on-field performance, Tareen expressed satisfaction with their first win of PSL Season 10. ""After the loss to Islamabad United in Rawalpindi, we were focused on bouncing back at home in Multan,"" he said. ""The coaches and I agreed there was no need to panic. We knew once we got back to Multan, we'd get things back on track."" While acknowledging the relatively subdued buzz around PSL X, he emphasised that the Sultans continue to play for their fans. ""We told the players they're playing for the people of Multan. That connection, that love — it's what drives us."" On talent development, Tareen proudly highlighted the success of the Tareen Cricket Academies. ""Our men's and women's academies are operating year-round. One standout story is Sheher Bano, a 14-year-old girl who joined us with no cricket experience. She's now represented Pakistan in the Under-19 Asia Cup and World Cup qualifiers,"" he shared. ""Our development squad under the JDW banner is participating in the PCB-organised President's Trophy Grade-II and I am pleased that they have done well in the opening two matches — taking first innings lead points in a drawn opening match and then recording a 10-wicket victory in the second match,"" Tareen said. Looking ahead, Tareen revealed plans to further develop cricket infrastructure in the region. ""We're working on building a stadium in DHA Multan, as well as enhancing facilities in Rahim Yar Khan and Bahawalpur. The goal is to create a strong, coordinated network across South Punjab for our teams and academies."""

Chasing a modest 169-run target, the visitors comfortably knocked the winning runs for the loss of just three wickets and 17 balls to spare. The three-time champions, however, got off to a contrasting start to the run chase as their in-form opener Sahibzada Farhan fell victim to Ubaid Shah the third over with 29 runs on the board. He could score 22 off 13 deliveries with the help of three fours and a six. Gous was then joined by experienced Colin Munro in the middle and together they put United in a commanding position by adding 81 runs for the second wicket until the latter was dismissed by compatriot Michael Bracewell in the 11th over. Munro smashed five fours and two sixes on his way to a 28-ball 45. Gous, on the other hand, carried his bat all the way through and returned unbeaten after top-scoring for United with a 45-ball 80, studded with six fours and five sixes. He also shared a 55-run partnership with Mohammad Nawaz, who scored a 19-ball 21. For Sultans, Chris Jordan, Ubaid and Bracewell could pick up one wicket apiece while the rest went wicketless. Opting to bat first, the home side got off to a cautious start to their innings as their in-form opening pair of skipper Mohammad Rizwan and Yasir Khan knitted 51 runs before the latter fell victim to Mohammad Nawaz in the seventh over. Yasir, who scored a match-winning 87-run knock against Lahore Qalandars at the same venue on Tuesday, could only muster 29 runs off 17 deliveries with the help of two fours and as many sixes against leaders United. Skipper Rizwan then shared a 65-run partnership for the second wicket with Usman until he got dismissed by United counterpart Shadab Khan. Rizwan scored a cautious 36 off 37 deliveries, managing to hit only three boundaries. The Sultans then suffered two more blows to their batting expedition as Michael Bracewell and Iftikhar Ahmed perished after making modest contributions. Usman, on the other hand, had an agonising end to his defiant knock as he got run out in the penultimate over.

Alzarri Joseph’s bowling exploits, backed by half-centuries from Babar Azam and Hussain Talat, propelled Zalmi to a comfortable victory over Qalandars. Chasing a modest 130-run target, the visitors knocked the winning runs for the loss of just three wickets and 20 balls to spare. Zalmi, however, had a contrasting start to their pursuit as they lost opening batter Saim Ayub (two) and Tom Kohler Cadmore (zero) inside two overs with just seven runs on the board. After the back-to-back blows, wicketkeeper batter Mohammad Haris joined Babar in the middle and launched a brief counterattack. The duo added a brisk 33 runs in 21 deliveries until Haris was outclassed by a Shaheen Shah Afridi’s slower delivery in the fifth over. Haris smashed two fours and two sixes on during his 16-ball 20. Babar and Hussain Talat then knitted a match-winning partnership for the fourth wicket and steered Zalmi over the line in the 17th over. Babar top-scored for Zalmi with an unbeaten 56 off 42 deliveries, studded with seven fours and a six, while Talat made 51 not out from 37 balls, laced with six boundaries including a six. Shaheen was the standout bowler for Qalandars, taking two wickets for 22 runs in his four overs, while Haris Rauf struck once. Zalmi captain Babar Azam’s decision to field first paid dividends as his team’s bowling unit dismantled Qalandars’ strong batting lineup, which could yield 128 runs before getting bundled out in 19.2 overs. The Qalandars’ woes started in the second over when their experienced opener Fakhar Zaman was cleaned up by Alzarri Joseph while playing a rash shot. He could score 10 off eight deliveries. The hosts then suffered a twin blow in the next over as Luke Wood got rid of makeshift opener Asif Ali (five) and Daryl Mitchell (two). The two-time champions then lost two more wickets in successive overs and were consequently reeling at 35/5 at the conclusion of the batting powerplay. With half of the side back in the hut, captain Shaheen Shah Afridi promoted himself to bat at number seven but could survive for 10 deliveries and walked back in the eight over after scoring 16. Following the slump, experienced all-rounder Sikandar Raza and Rishad Hossain attempted to force a comeback and batted cautiously for a 23-run partnership for the seventh wicket, which culminated in the 11th over when the latter was caught behind off Joseph. Hossain made a run-a-ball 13 with the help of one four and a six. Raza then knitted a one-sided 36-run partnership for the eighth wicket with Haris Rauf, who scored 10 off 14 deliveries before being cleaned up by Arif Yaqoob in the 16th over. The all-rounder was eventually dismissed by Hussain Talat in the final over. He remained the top-scorer for the Qalandars with a 36-ball 52, comprised of five fours and three sixes. Alzarri Joseph was the standout bowler for Zalmi, taking three wickets for just 16 runs in his four overs. He was supported by Luke Wood and Hussain Talat, who took two each, while Arif Yaqoob and Ali Raza chipped in with one strike apiece.

Relations between nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have plummeted to their lowest level in years after the killing of 26 tourists on Wednesday. A day before the attack, Chopra had announced that the world's top throwers, including Paris Olympics champion Nadeem, had been invited to the first Neeraj Chopra Classic on May 24, an event he hoped would pave the way for a Diamond League meet in India one day. However, the attack in IIOJK prompted heavy criticism of Chopra's decision to invite Nadeem, even though it was unlikely the Pakistan thrower was going to attend. ""There has been so much talk about my decision to invite Arshad Nadeem to compete in the Neeraj Chopra Classic, and most of it has been hate and abuse,"" Chopra, who won gold in Tokyo and silver in Paris, said in a social media post on Friday. ""The invitation I extended to Arshad was from one athlete to another — nothing more, nothing less. The aim of the NC Classic was to bring the best athletes to India and for our country to be the home of world-class sporting events. ""After all that has taken place over the last 48 hours, Arshad's presence at the NC Classic was completely out of the question."" Media reports said Nadeem, Pakistan's first individual Olympic gold medallist, had opted not to attend the Bengaluru meet, which clashed with his training schedule for the Asian Championships in South Korea next month. The soured relations between the two countries also spilled over to the sports world earlier this year when India's cricket team refused to travel to Pakistan for the International Cricket Council's (ICC) Champions Trophy and played all their matches, including the March 9 final, in Dubai."

The match, highly anticipated due to the historic sporting rivalry between Pakistan and India, marked Wazeer’s 16th professional fight. The 23-year-old extended his undefeated record to an impressive 16-0, with the fight concluding just one minute and 41 seconds into the opening round. As the bell rang, Wazeer wasted no time, launching the first attack that set the pace of the fight. Eswaran responded with aggression, and the bout quickly turned into an explosive exchange. However, Wazeer displayed superior technique and composure, landing a series of powerful blows that knocked Eswaran down twice before the referee stepped in to stop the contest. Dubbed the “Asian Boy,” Wazeer has already made waves in the boxing world, having previously secured prestigious titles including the World Youth Title, Asian Title, and Middle East Title. His achievements have not only brought global recognition but also immense pride to Pakistan and his native region of Gilgit-Baltistan. Following his emphatic win, Wazeer expressed gratitude and delivered a powerful message of unity. “Alhamdulillah for this victory. I’m grateful to Highland Boxing Promotion, my sponsors, and the Sindh Government for their support,” he said. He also addressed the growing social media buzz surrounding the match, urging fans on both sides of the border to embrace peace. “I saw posts comparing this to an India-Pakistan war. I sincerely request both nations — we want peace. Let sports bring us together, not divide us,” he concluded."

The singer, who has roots in Pakistani Punjab through his parents, has previously sung for several Pakistani cinema projects including the Jannan film. On the weekend he performed at two shows in Leicester and London. Armaan Malik said, “I returned to the UK stage after a long gap of eight years on the invitation of Rock on Music’s Vijay Bhola. He has done an amazing job for me and I cannot thank him enough. This was an incredible experience for me to perform at two sold out shows. Both concerts were packed with Asian fans who sang along to every word, creating an unforgettable atmosphere.” Armaan Malik told Geo News his favourite Pakistani singers were Atif Aslam and Asim Azhar. “I would like to collaborate with them and others,” said the singer who has collaborated with Ed Sheeran as well. Vijay Bhola, the South Asian arts promoter who organised Rahat Fateh Ali Khan’s three sold out UK shows last week, said he decided to bring Armaan Malik to the UK audience to give them the opportunity to listen directly to someone who is behind some of the most popular recent Bollywood songs. Vijay Bhola commented, “Fans from all age groups attended the concert, although most of the fans who attended the concerts were young Asians, enthralled by the romantic songs of Malik. The Malik family is known for its impact on the Asian music industry.” Accompanying Armaan Malik was his father Daboo Malik, the famous music composer and writer. He said, “It was one of the most incredible nights. It was a dream come true for all of us as Armaan performed after eight years. Vijay Bhola and his production team made it a fantastic tour. The audience was fantastic.”"

The well-known singer has been sharing fun-filled video clips with relatable point-of-view content, sparking excitement in the comments section. From playful moments to everyday humour, his recent posts have added a refreshing twist to his usually private persona. Let’s dive into the videos that have turned Atif from a rockstar to a reel star. One of the videos that clicked with meme lovers shows Atif as a guy sitting sadly outside a decorated house, clearly a wedding venue. The story? A heartbroken youngster whose girl got married to someone else, even after saying she wouldn’t. The simple setup, mixed with his perfectly sad expression, had people cracking up as it was just the right mix of funny and relatable. The video was shared around Valentine's Day. Another video that caught the netizens' attention was shared around the time when the country was hosting the Champions Trophy 2025. Atif channelled a cricket lover completely lost in the joy of hitting the perfect shot during a match. The best part — the incredible singer has used his own hits as the background sounds in these two reels. The next video was a POV clip that struck a chord with netizens — that painfully relatable moment when you mess up a voice note on the first try, and then can’t recreate the same energy the second time around. In this light-hearted POV, Atif plays the role of a grown man calling his mom to let her know he’s landed safely — a sweet, all-too-familiar moment for many. Standing at the airport with a travel bag and phone pressed to his ear, he captures that mix of duty, love, and routine. One of the videos featured the famous singer silhouetted against the sunlight in a scenic field of wild bushes, casually crooning a song. The visuals and voice are so beautiful and raw that the fans can't get enough of them. Some of the most interesting comments this video garnered were: ""Bro eat autotune in breakfast"", ""When you randomly start singing, but you’re Atif Aslam"", ""Bro flexing his voice as if he is Atif Aslam"". Next up is a hilarious POV featuring a group of schoolboys who, in true drama-filled fashion, have called up their college friends for backup in a “school fight”. The over-the-top seriousness and unnecessary reinforcements make for a moment that’s both funny and relatable. Fun fact — the schoolboys are played by emerging stars Hasan Raheem and Abdul Hannan, while the “big boys” bringing in the backup are none other than Atif and Faris Shafi. Last but not least, this video is a star-studded affair as it features the ultimate heartthrob Fawad Khan, filmmaker Bilal Lashari and rap star Faris Shafi alongside Atif Aslam. The video, shot at a recent entertainment industry meet-and-greet, captures the vibe of a long-overdue reunion between old friends, with the stars walking in with undeniable swag."

Fans are eagerly awaiting Fawad's return to Indian cinema and his portrayal of Abir Singh, a character full of depth and charisma."

After the attack, some Indian film bodies are now opposing the release of Abir Gulaal , his upcoming film with Vaani Kapoor. The Humsafar actor condemned the attack on Wednesday night, saying his thoughts and prayers were with the victims. It is important to note that the Indian government has blamed Pakistan for the attack. They have alleged Islamabad’s support for “cross-border terrorism” but Pakistan has denied any role and said it had nothing to do with the attack. According to The Indian Express , the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) called for a boycott of Pakistani artists. ""In the wake of these repeated attacks, FWICE reaffirms its unwavering commitment to national interest and solidarity. We reiterate our directive, originally issued on February 18, 2019, calling for complete non-cooperation with all Pakistan artists, singers, and technicians within the Indian film and entertainment industry,"" it said in a statement. It added: “Despite this ongoing directive, we have been made aware of the recent collaboration with Pakistani actor Fawad Khan for the Hindi film Abir Gulaal. In light of the recent attack in Pahalgam, FWICE is once again compelled to issue a blanket boycott on all Pakistani artists, singers, and technicians participating in any Indian film or entertainment projects. This includes performances or collaborations occurring anywhere in the world.” It was emphaised by the statement that any members of FWICE working with Pakistani actors would face disciplinary action and the organisation would “take all necessary steps to ensure that Abir Gulaal is not released in India.” The statement was shared on Instagram by FWICE Chief Advisor Ashoke Pandit. According to NDTV , Pandit, who also serves as the president of the Indian Film and Television Directors’ Association, said: “This incident is an act of war against the nation. This isn’t the first time…these attacks have been ongoing for 30 years. We, as a federation, have requested with folded hands to not work Pakistanis."" Referring to Kapoor, he added that if the film’s heroine or makers’ family members were shot by terrorists, they wouldn’t have worked with Khan. Additionally, prior to the Pahalgam attacks, Abir Gulaal faced opposition from right-wing political factions in India. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) objected to the film’s release in Maharashtra. MNS spokesperson Ameya Khopkar said his party would not allow the film to be screened in the state due to a Pakistani actor’s involvement. Moreover, the Humsafar actor, like many other Pakistani actors, has condemned the attack. In an Instagram story posted Wednesday night, he wrote: “Deeply saddened to hear the news of the heinous attack in Pahalgam. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this horrifying incident, and we pray for strength and healing for their families in this difficult time.” Kapoor, also taking to Instagram, wrote: “Have been numb, at a loss of words since the time I have seen the attack on innocent people in Pahalgam. Gutted. Devastated. My prayers are with the families.”"

India blamed Pakistan for the attack and suspended the 65-year-old Indus Water Treaty (IWT) that shares critical water between the two neighbours. Pakistan closed its airspace for Indian airlines and rejected New Delhi's suspension of IWT on Thursday in retaliation for India's response to the militant attack on tourists in IIOJK. Pahalgam, known for its natural beauty, draws thousands of visitors each summer. Violence had eased in the area in recent years, making the attack even more shocking. The film — also starring Vaani Kapoor and set to release on May 9 — was meant to mark Khan’s return to Bollywood. He earlier appeared in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil , Khoobsurat , and Kapoor & Sons . Khan, along with other Pakistani artists, was banned from working in Indian films after the Uri attack. Despite being ready for release, the film has been barred in India, casting a shadow over the Pakistani heartthrob’s return to Bollywood. Following the attack, Indian film bodies called for a ban on Abir Gulaal . The Humsafar actor condemned the attack on Wednesday night, saying his thoughts and prayers were with the victims. It is important to note that the Indian government has pinned the attack on Pakistan without any evidence to back their wild claims. They have alleged Islamabad’s support for “cross-border terrorism” but Pakistan has denied any role and said it had nothing to do with the attack. A day after the attack, the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) called for a boycott of Pakistani artists, according to The Indian Express.

The controversy erupted after Fawad commented on Indian Home Minister Amit Shah’s latest order, which directs all Pakistani citizens residing in India to depart by April 27. Medical visa holders have been given an extended deadline until April 29. Taking a swipe at the Indian move, Fawad posted on X, “What about Adnan Sami?” — questioning whether the singer would also be asked to leave. Sami, now a naturalised Indian citizen since 2016, did not take the comment lightly. Responding sharply, he called Fawad an ""illiterate idiot"" and reminded him that he had legally secured Indian citizenship years ago. The exchange did not end there. Fawad retorted by reminding Sami of his origins, saying, “Adnan Sami is from Lahore.” The former minister chimed in with a tongue-in-cheek comment: “Our very own Lahori Adnan Sami aisay lag rahay hein jaisey balooon se hawa nikal chuki hooo [Our very own Adnan Sami looks like all the air has been let out of a balloon]... get well soon @AdnanSamiLive.” Sami shot back again, correcting him: “My roots are from Peshawar, not Lahore! To think that you were Minister of (Mis)Information and have no knowledge about any information!” In a scathing follow-up, Sami added sarcastically, “Meri tho hawa nikal gaee — tu abhi bhi balloon hai [The air has been let out of me, but you are still a balloon]! And you were Minister of Science?” The heated exchange comes in the backdrop of deteriorating Pakistan-India relations following the April 22 attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), which resulted in the deaths of 26 Indian tourists. In response, India suspended visa services for Pakistani nationals and directed all Pakistanis to leave the country by April 27. Medical visa holders have been allowed to stay until April 29. Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated that all existing Pakistani visas will be revoked, and any Pakistani staying beyond the deadline would be considered in violation of Indian immigration laws. Adnan Sami, once a prominent figure in Pakistan's music industry, moved to India in the early 2000s and formally acquired Indian citizenship in 2016. Over the years, he has often publicly expressed gratitude towards India, describing his shift as his “destiny.” The recent online spat highlights the ongoing tensions not just at the diplomatic level, but also on cultural and social fronts between the two countries."

This concert marked their debut performance in London and was presented by Rafi Peer Global Entertainment. The band was in the UK for two shows and performed in Manchester on Friday night to a packed audience. The London show at the iconic Barbican Centre demonstrated how much Jaffer Zaidi and Maaz Maudood’s niche music is liked by their devoted fans, mainly from India and Pakistan. The Barbican Centre, which has a capacity of around 2,000 people, was fully packed and the audience sang along with the band – (Zaidi, singing and piano; Maudood, lead guitars; Louis John Pinto (Gumby) on drums;  Danish Khawaja on guitars; and Waleed Shahzada on bass guitar) – throughout during their non-stop two hours long performance. The band, formed in 1998 by Zaidi, son of late Nayyara Noor, and Maudood, is renowned for blending classical influences with contemporary sensibilities. Their performance featured beloved songs such as “Bachpan,” “Tere Pyaar Mein,” “Moray Sayyaan,” “Nindiya Re,” and “Faasle”. The band gained a lot of prominence after their acclaimed performances in Coke Studios and some of their hit collaborations but they have returned to live shows after a break of nearly 14 years. They have been out in Pakistani cities over the last year at sold-out shows – taking the band recently to Dhaka and now to London. Speaking to Geo News after the concert, Zaidi and Maudood thanked the UK audience for their love and appreciation. They said: “We knew we have a lot of following in the UK but were not aware that it’s mind-blowing to the extent that thousands of people sing each and every line with you, and ask for the same again and again. It’s because we create soulful music that brings peace and satisfaction to the listeners.” The band accepted that their fans expect much more from them in terms of public appearances and more music. They said: “We take our time to create music. We are in no rush. We aim to create timeless and borderless music and that takes effort, time and reflection. You will see us doing a lot of live shows in the coming days.” Pakistan’s most prominent drummer Gumby brought the audience to their feet when he did a solo set and also went blazing with his drums between the songs. He has been touring with Ustad Rahat Fateh Ali Khan for several years but now playing with Kaavish. “It was too hectic for several years with the international and Pakistan tours. With Kaavish, it's less hectic and peaceful. I needed this.” The band was brought to the UK by Rafi Peer Global Entertainment. Its director Alena Peerzada commented: “Kaavish’s music, I feel, has a league of its own. It’s pure, it’s timeless, and it speaks straight to the heart.

At Dubai’s top destination for family entertainment, Global Village, Pakistani singer Atif Aslam mesmerised audiences with his soulful voice and captivating performance, bringing people from both sides of the border to sing and dance as one. Amid strained relations, Atif Aslam’s concert became a symbol of cultural and artistic harmony. Indian fans enjoyed Urdu and Punjabi songs, while Pakistanis joined in the celebration of Bollywood classics. This rare moment of togetherness showed the power of music to bridge divides and create unforgettable memories, some enthusiasts stated. Over two hours, Atif Aslam entertained the crowd with songs in Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, and English. From strumming his guitar to showcasing energetic dance moves, he left the audience spellbound. His iconic hits, including “Pehli Nazar Mein” and “Woh Lamhe” , along with timeless classics like  “Ek Pyar Ka Nagma Hai” and “Lambi Judai” , were met with thunderous applause from both Pakistani and Indian fans alike. Dubai, renowned for its multicultural population, once again demonstrated its ability to unite neighbours in celebration and joy, even during challenging times. The organiser expressed the hope for peace. Despite escalating geopolitical tensions between the two neighbours, the event, equally enjoyed by Atif’s Indian fans alongside their Pakistani counterparts, stands as testimony that people on the other side of the divide have rejected Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s jingoistic politics. After the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 and injured several tourists in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without offering any evidence and suspended the 65-year-old Indus Water Treaty (IWT) that shares critical water between the two neighbours. Pakistan closed its airspace for Indian airlines and rejected New Delhi's suspension of IWT on Thursday in retaliation for India's response to the militant attack on tourists in IIOJK. Observers say sports, dance, and music have nothing to do with national or international politics, and no nation should politicise them. However, even the sub-continent's most popular sport, like cricket, also became ""hostage"" to Modi's hardline political narrative. India never fails to politicise even non-political ventures like sports, music, and cultural exchanges. Recently, India refused to send its team to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy 2025, and it also did not allow its captain, Rohit Sharma, to visit Lahore for a group photo with the captains of all the participating teams — something entirely against the spirit of the game. Interestingly, the two teams and players maintain cordial relationships and were generally disappointed, believing that if the teams could play on ""neutral grounds,"" why not in front of their own people?"
‘Please just let me breathe': Alizeh Shah opens up about her silence,"Apr 29, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/602401-please-just-let-me-breathe-alizeh-shah-opens-up-about-her-silence,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-04-29/602401_1579228_updates.jpg,"In an emotional Instagram post, actor Alizeh Shah opened up about the toll that constant trolling and criticism have taken on her, both mentally and physically, breaking her silence — not for attention, but for peace. “The trolling, the constant criticism, the negativity didn’t just hurt me emotionally; it’s now affecting my physical health,” the young celebrity shared. The starlet, who shot to fame with the TV show Ehd-e-Wafa , said it got so bad that she had to pull away from everyone and everything. “It reached a point where I had no choice but to isolate myself completely, not just from social media, but from everyone around me.” Shah described herself as “broken, exhausted, and overwhelmed,” saying words alone can't explain the weight she's been carrying. Even though she changed her Instagram bio to say she’s alive, the rumours didn’t stop. “News channels have contacted my parents, asking if I’m dead. Imagine what that does to a family, to a mother’s heart.” She said the pressure has made her physically sick, and she doesn’t know if she’ll return to Instagram — or even TV — anytime soon. “Right now, I genuinely don’t know when or if I’ll ever return to Instagram or TV dramas.” Her message was clear: she just needs space. “Please stop contacting my family. Please stop making up stories. Please just let me breathe.” For fans and media alike, it’s a simple request from someone clearly in pain. Shah has often found herself at the centre of harsh judgment — whether it was for smoking, cutting her hair short, setting boundaries on set, or simply for what she wore. She was also dragged into a public spat with actor Zarnish Khan, who had once made hurtful comments about her. Even though Zarnish later apologised, Alizeh didn’t accept it, saying the harm had already been done. Last year, Shah clapped back at haters for trolling her fashion choices while she was vacationing in the US. “I know being a Pakistani and having a different sense of fashion causes a lot [of] issues for people but really is that even my problem?” wrote an enraged Alizeh in her Instagram Stories. Shah, who has starred beside the likes of Mahira Khan and Bilal Ashraf in the film “Superstar”, highlighted the “hypocrisy” of people who “love watching these Pakistani actresses wearing choti si choli (a small and short sleeved blouse) and lehnga in movies and enjoy that but if we wear something that we like u start calling us out? And for what?”. Towards the end of the note, the young actor stated that she is “done tolerating” the backlash from the trolls. “I AM A PUBLIC FIGURE not a PUBLIC PROPERTY so keep your lame opinions to yourself! I’m done tolerating!,” she added. Shah is widely known for her vibrant looks and fashion choices, and she often posts pictures and videos of herself that show she is having a good time. But all has not been good for the Taqdeer actor as she has been constantly facing comments from the public on her Instagram account. Back in May 2024, Alizeh had again been targeted because of her clothing choices, prompting the Dil Mom Ka Diya star to respond to the comments. “I find all memes and criticism amusing. However, the fact that a trivial topic to discuss is now the most trending issue in our country instead of becoming a voice for Palestine. What’s wrong with our people?,"" she had written on her Instagram stories."

Shahid Afridi slams India's baseless allegations over Pahalgam attack,"Apr 26, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/601876-shahid-afridi-slams-indias-baseless-allegations-over-pahalgam-attack,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,,"Pakistan cricket team's former captain, Shahid Afridi, has voiced concern over India’s premature and unsubstantiated accusations against Pakistan following the recent Pahalgam attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). Speaking to the media in Dubai, Afridi criticised New Delhi for blaming Pakistan without any evidence, calling the act both ""unfortunate and unjustified."" He said India was too quick to hold Pakistan responsible for the incident, which resulted in the loss of lives in the occupied territory. Afridi further expressed sorrow over the loss of human lives in Kashmir and condemned the increasing wave of terrorist attacks within Pakistan. He called for diplomacy to be the path forward between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, stating, ""Dialogue is the only solution to our issues; conflict brings no benefit."" Emphasising the need to keep sports separate from political tensions, the former skipper urged both nations to ensure cricket is not dragged into geopolitical disputes. Tensions are running high between nuclear-armed neighbours after Tuesday's deadly gun attack in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir's (IIOJK) Pahalgam area killed at least 27 tourists, pushing bilateral ties to a new low in nearly two decades. A day after the attack, New Delhi suspended a water-sharing treaty, announced the closure of the main land border crossing with Pakistan, downgraded diplomatic ties, and withdrew visas for Pakistanis. In response, Islamabad ordered the expulsion of Indian diplomats and military advisers, cancelling visas for Indian nationals, except Sikh pilgrims — and closing the main border crossing from its side. Pakistan also warned any attempt by India to stop the supply of water from the Indus River would be an ""act of war"". Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since its independence in 1947. India still has not fulfilled its promise of holding a UN-mandated plebiscite."

Qalandars comfortably chased a challenging 186-run target down with five wickets in hand and six balls remaining. The home side faced an early setback when opener Mohammad Naeem departed for just six runs, dismissed by Josh Little in the second over with only 12 runs on the board. Recovering from the early blow, Fakhar Zaman and Abdullah Shafique added 33 runs for the second wicket before Mohammad Hasnain removed Fakhar immediately after the powerplay. Fakhar contributed 28 off 22 deliveries, hitting three fours and two sixes. Abdullah then partnered with Daryl Mitchell for a 49-run stand to keep Qalandars’ chase on track. However, Ubaid Shah jolted the hosts with two quick wickets, dismissing Shafique and Sam Billings — the latter for a three-ball duck — in a crucial 12th over. Shafique’s innings featured two fours and two sixes in his 34 runs from 25 balls. At 95/4 in 12 overs, Qalandars were under pressure but Mitchell and Sikandar Raza turned the game around with a blistering 89-run partnership for the fifth wicket, putting the hosts within touching distance of victory. Mitchell top-scored for Qalandars with a sparkling 64 from 38 balls, laced with four fours and four sixes, before falling in the penultimate over. Raza, meanwhile, stayed unbeaten, steering his side home with a fiery 40 off just 21 deliveries, including two fours and four sixes. For Sultans, Ubaid Shah stood out with two wickets, while Mohammad Hasnain, Akif Javed, and Josh Little chipped in with one wicket each. Earlier, skipper Mohammad Rizwan and Kamran Ghulam struck pivotal half-centuries to guide Multan Sultans to an imposing total against Lahore Qalandars. The Sultans posted a challenging 185/3 in their 20 overs, anchored by a game-changing unbeaten fourth-wicket stand between Rizwan and Ghulam. The visitors made a cautious start before opener Yasir Khan injected some momentum, smashing a six and a four before falling to a sharp delivery that ended the opening stand. Yasir contributed a quick 24 off 18 balls, hitting three boundaries and a maximum. Rizwan then stitched two small partnerships — first with Usman Khan and then with Shai Hope — who chipped in with 18 off 14 and nine off nine balls, respectively. With the scoreboard at 70/3 in 10.1 overs, Kamran Ghulam joined Rizwan at the crease, and the pair stabilised the innings with a composed and aggressive unbeaten 115-run stand. Rizwan top-scored with an unbeaten 76 off 48 balls, featuring six boundaries and three sixes, while Ghulam supported brilliantly with a 31-ball 52 not out, which included two fours and four sixes.

Among them, all eyes will be on 64-year-old Hamid Butt from Lahore, who stands to make history as the first Pakistani to complete the coveted six-star marathon achievement twice — having already finished all six World Marathon Majors (Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York) once before. The diverse group of competitors represents Pakistan's growing presence in global marathon running, with participants hailing from multiple countries including the United States, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Norway and Saudi Arabia. Several athletes arrive in London with tired legs but determined spirits, having just completed last week's Boston Marathon. ""I ran London last year and remember seeing people in their Boston jackets coming to pick up the London bib and thinking one day that will be me,"" said Hira Diwan, a UK-based runner who completed the Boston Marathon just six days ago along with fellow Pakistani-origin runners Salman Ilyas and Aamer Butt from the US. ""And it came true the very next year,"" she added, reflecting on her rapid progression in the sport. The London event holds special significance for British-Pakistani diversity advocate Semeena Khan, who will be running her sixth London Marathon while serving as Community Lead for Muslim Runners UK. Among the competitors from Pakistan itself, Karachi-based TV anchor Mona Khan arrives at the start line after an intense training regimen balanced with her demanding media career. Coached by fellow participant Muhammad Yousuf Malik, Khan's journey to London has been marked by personal sacrifices. ""For Pakistani runners, every running track is a battlefield, and we run with our hearts,"" she said. ""I've cut my hair for ease, my arms have darkened from running in the sun, and I've got injuries on my knee and elbow... but I'm still running. Nothing can stop me."" The marathon also marks a personal milestone for Islamabad's Furqan Masood, representing the Islamabad Running Club. His journey from casual runner to marathon competitor encapsulates the growing running culture in Pakistan. ""Tomorrow, I'll be at the start line of the London Marathon 2025, joining 55,000 runners from around the world,"" Masood said. ""Three years ago, I found IRC, and what started as a simple fitness routine turned into a mission — to build resilience, inspire others, and prove that discipline can achieve anything."" For first-time marathoner Hira Mufti, a 42-year-old British-Pakistani mother of three, Sunday's race represents both a personal challenge and a tribute to her heritage. ""I'm running as a proud Pakistani Muslim, mother of 3, to honor my late father, without whom I would not be here today,"" Mufti explained. ""He instilled in me the all-important life lessons of resilience, endurance, compassion, love for humanity and love for my country."" The symbolic nature of her run isn't lost on Mufti, who noted: ""Of course AGE IS IMPORTANT I'm 42 and running 42 km to mark each wonderful year of my life."" The Pakistani contingent also includes athletes like Norwegian-Pakistani runner Amy Mir, whose marathon participation fits into a broader athletic journey. ""Actually I started Running when I was born. I never sat where my parents left me, or peacefully enjoyed sitting with both legs on a chair,"" Mir said with characteristic humor. ""My sport career started with soccer, sprint on track or trailrun while hiking, muay thai, river kayaking, triathlon, skiing as expedition with sled, and now high altitude mountaineering. Marathon is just a stop along my journey. Journey to K2 summit, in 2026."" Complete list of Pakistani and Pakistani-origin participants:"
End of an era? Djokovic hints at Madrid farewell after defeat,"Apr 27, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/601976-end-of-an-era-djokovic-hints-at-madrid-farewell-after-defeat,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-04-27/601976_2984135_updates.jpg,"MADRID: Novak Djokovic has suggested that he may have played at the Madrid Open for the final time. The three-time champion crashed out in the second round on Saturday, losing to Italy’s Matteo Arnaldi. After the defeat, the Serbian star admitted he was not sure if he would return to the tournament. Arnaldi beat fourth seed Djokovic 6-3 6-4 to reach the third round. The result condemned the 37-year-old, who received a bye in the opening round, to his third consecutive defeat. Djokovic, who has been chasing a 100th tour-level title, was handed a shock defeat in the Miami Open final in late March before his second-round Monte Carlo exit earlier this month. All three defeats came in straight sets. ""Obviously after you lose a match you don't feel good, but I've had a few of these this year where I lose in the first round, unfortunately,"" Djokovic told a press conference. ""I think the positive thing is that I really enjoyed myself more than I have in Monte-Carlo or some other tournament, so that's a good thing. ""But obviously still level of tennis is not where I would like it to be. But it is what it is. I lost to a better player."" Djokovic, who made his Madrid debut in 2006 and won the tournament in 2011, 2016 and 2019, was looking for his first win on clay since defeating Carlos Alcaraz to win gold at the Paris Olympics. Asked whether he just played his last match in Madrid, Djokovic said: ""It could be. It could be. I'm not sure if I will come back. So, I don't know, I don't know what to say. ""I mean, I'll come back, maybe not as a player. I hope it's not, but it could be."" Djokovic won three out of the four major titles in 2023 but has not been able to reproduce that kind of form since, being shut out of the game's biggest tournaments last year as Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz claimed majors apiece. ""(It's) kind of new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament,"" Djokovic added. ""It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kind of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments. ""But that's, I guess, the circle of life and the career, eventually it was going to happen."" The former world number one owns ATP Masters 1000 records for most wins (414), semi-finals (79), finals (60) and titles (40)."
Barcelona edge Real Madrid in extra-time to win Copa del Rey,"Apr 27, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/601988-barcelona-beat-real-madrid-3-2-in-extra-time-to-win-copa-del-rey,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-04-27/601988_523575_updates.jpg,"SEVILLE: Barcelona defender Jules Kounde struck deep in extra-time to decide a gripping Copa del Rey Clasico final on Saturday in Seville, earning his side a 3-2 win over rivals Real Madrid. The Catalans, aiming for a quadruple this season, won the first major trophy of Hansi Flick’s reign as coach and a record-extending 32nd Spanish cup in dramatic fashion. Pedri sent Barcelona ahead at La Cartuja but two Real Madrid goals in seven second-half minutes, from Kylian Mbappe and Aurelien Tchouameni, pulled the Spanish and European champions level. However, Ferran Torres struck in the 84th minute to take the game to extra-time and Kounde drilled home to win it for the La Liga leaders. Substituted Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger was sent off in the final seconds for appearing to throw an object onto the pitch towards the referee. Madrid, who started with top scorer Mbappe on the bench after an ankle injury, suffered an early setback when left-back Ferland Mendy, playing his first game for six weeks, suffered a thigh injury. Carlo Ancelotti sent on Fran Garcia in his place, with the job of shackling Barcelona’s dazzling teenage winger Lamine Yamal. The 17-year-old Spain star, who dyed his hair blond for the game, burst past him with ease as Barca threatened Thibaut Courtois’ goal increasingly. The Catalans, who won the first two Clasicos this season in La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup, scoring nine goals in the process, controlled the ball. They took the lead after 28 minutes, Pedri placing the ball into the top corner with precision and power from the edge of the box. It was a sensational goal, starting with a smart Pau Cubarsi interception in his own half. Pedri spread the play out to Yamal on the right, who cut inside and held the ball up until the Canary Islander reached the box and had a sight of goal. Madrid had been focused on defending but Barcelona’s opener brought them out of their shell — and also brought Mbappe off the bench to warm up. Jude Bellingham started and finished a superb move but was offside, and Vinicius Junior would have won a penalty as Inigo Martinez hacked him down but had also strayed off in the build-up. Barcelona could have doubled their lead, with Dani Olmo’s corner evading several players and bouncing off the far post, with Cubarsi unable to get there as Dani Ceballos held him back. Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea was lenient with some heated Madrid tackles, perhaps cowed by Friday’s drama as the Spanish champions seethed at his pre-match comments denouncing attacks on officials by the club’s television channel. Madrid sent Mbappe on for Rodrygo Goes at half-time and soon they began to work Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny with Vinicius and Mbappe coming close. Mbappe pulled Madrid level almost on his own in the 70th minute. The striker surged forward and was brought down on the edge of the box by Frenkie de Jong. Mbappe took the free-kick himself and fired a low effort in off the post. Seven minutes later Madrid took the lead, Tchouameni finding space to head home Arda Guler’s corner past the helpless Szczesny. Barcelona responded when Yamal played a delicious pass over the top for Torres, which drew both Rudiger and Courtois, but the Spaniard got there first and rolled home. Controversy unsurprisingly reared its head before the match headed to extra-time. Barcelona clamoured for a penalty when Rudiger appeared to bring down Torres, and then were awarded one deep in stoppage time as Raphinha tumbled under pressure from Raul Asencio. However, the referee, called to review the incident by VAR, overturned his decision and booked the Brazilian for diving. In extra-time Barcelona were ascendant and probed for a potential winner. They eventually found it when Kounde intercepted an uncharacteristically loose Luka Modric pass and beat Courtois with a powerful low effort from outside the box, sparking wild celebrations. Rudiger’s dismissal and Madrid’s pre-match histrionics regarding the refereeing team will ensure the repercussions run on — and the teams meet again in La Liga in May, which could decide the title race."

Chasing a 179-run target, Zalmi’s batting unit unfolded on a meagre 114 in 15.2 overs. Middle-order batter Hussain Talat waged a lone battle for Zalmi with a 34-ball 39, laced with four fours and two sixes, before falling victim to Abrar Ahmed in the 15th over. Besides him, skipper Babar Azam (12), Mohammad Haris (17) and Mitchell Owen (15) were the other batters to amass double figures, depicting Zalmi’s against Gladiators’ pace-laden bowling attack. Faheem was the standout bowler for the Gladiators, taking five wickets for just 33 runs in his 3.2 overs, followed by Khurram Shahzad with two, while Mohammad Amir, Abrar Ahmed and Mohammad Wasim shared three between them. Earlier, Alzarri Joseph spearheaded the attack with exceptional figures of 3/33, limiting Quetta Gladiators to 178/7. The Gladiators got off to a decent start to their innings as their opening pair of Finn Allen and Saud Shakeel yielded brisk 46 runs. Allen, who was the core aggressor of the opening was the first to depart as he fell victim to Alzarri Joseph on the third delivery of the fifth over. He scored 31 off 16 deliveries with the help of four fours and two sixes. Shakeel was then involved in another important partnership for the Gladiators when he knitted 45 runs for the second wicket with Rilee Rossouw before Saim Ayub dismissed both set batters in his successive overs, bringing the total down to 105/3 in 11.2 overs. The skipper struck five fours on his way to a 26-ball 32, while Rossouw made 27 off 18 deliveries, hitting as many boundaries. Following the back-to-back blows, Kusal Mendis and Mark Chapman stitched an anchoring 39-run partnership for the fourth wicket until Joseph got the former caught behind in the 17th over. Mendis scored 32 off 27 deliveries with the help of five boundaries. Chapman, on the other hand, fell victim to Luke Wood in the final over after top-scoring for the Gladiators with a 33 off 26 deliveries, laced with three boundaries. Azlarri Joseph was the standout bowler for Zalmi, taking three wickets for just 33 runs in his four overs, followed by Ayub with two, while Wood chipped in with one scalp.

Furqan Masood leads Pakistan's charge at 2025 London Marathon,"Apr 27, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/602116-furqan-masood-leads-pakistans-charge-at-2025-london-marathon,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-04-27/602116_470433_updates.jpg,"Over 40 Pakistani runners and members of the diaspora represented Pakistan at the 2025 London Marathon, with Furqan Masood from Islamabad emerging as the fastest among them, completing the race in an impressive 3 hours, 10 minutes, and 7 seconds. The 2025 London Marathon saw a strong contingent of Pakistani runners and diaspora members. Furqan Masood’s performance, marked by steady pacing early on before battling fatigue in the latter stages, highlighted the determination of amateur athletes representing Pakistan on the global stage. Masood, running with the Islamabad Running Club, maintained a strong start, clocking 20:44 for the first 5K and 42:09 at the 10K mark. However, the rising temperatures and grueling course took a toll, as his splits slowed in the second half, particularly after the 30K mark, where he faced a challenging 23:02 segment between 25K and 30K. Despite the struggle, he pushed through the final split in 24:14, crossing the finish line in 4,460th place overall in an event that saw over 56,000 runners ""Crossing the finish line at the London Marathon was a deeply humbling experience. The energy of the crowd and the incredible support from my club, IRC, and the Pakistani community truly lifted my spirits,” Furqan told Geo News after his run. “Today’s run was particularly tough, with the course much hotter than usual, making it a real test of endurance. We are not professional runners; our purpose in participating in such prestigious international events is to inspire people back home in Pakistan. We want to show that running can be more than just a sport, it can be a hobby, a passion, and a way to lead a healthier lifestyle,” he added. Close behind Masood was USA-based Salman Ilyas, finishing in 3:18:33, followed by Norway-based Muhammad Fasih Saleh (3:21:54) and Hamza Saleem (3:23:10). Shah Syed, another Pakistani runner, delivered a near-identical time of 3:23:12, showcasing the competitive spirit among the group. Norwegian-Pakistani runner Amy Mir was the fastest woman of Pakistani origin, completing the race in 3:52:00. Despite limited training, she embraced the challenge with enthusiasm. ""I hadn’t trained beyond 17K, but the energy of the crowd was unbelievable,"" Mir said as she completed her first ever marathon. The event also marked a historic milestone for Lahore’s Hamid Butt, 64, who became the first Pakistani to twice complete the Abbott World Marathon Majors — Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago, and New York — earning his second six-star medal with a time of 3:41:45. In the elite races, Kenya’s Sabastian Sawe dominated the men’s division in 2:02:27, while Ethiopia’s Tigst Assefa set a blistering pace in the women’s race, winning in 2:15:50.

Liverpool thrash Tottenham to secure Premier League title,"Apr 28, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/602172-liverpool-thrash-tottenham-to-secure-premier-league-title,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-04-28/602172_8089513_updates.jpg,"LIVERPOOL: Liverpool roared back from a goal behind to thrash Tottenham Hotspur 5-1 and wrap up the Premier League title in style on a momentous day at a sun-drenched Anfield on Sunday. Needing only a point to ensure a record-equalling 20th English title with four games remaining, Liverpool were rocked in the 12th minute as Dominic Solanke headed Tottenham in front. But the title party was only temporarily silenced as Liverpool struck back with a Luis Diaz tap-in, an Alexis Mac Allister thunderbolt and a Cody Gakpo shot before halftime. A one-sided second half saw Mohamed Salah end a six-match scoring drought by firing a low shot past Guglielmo Vicario in the 63rd minute — celebrating his 28th league goal of an outstanding season by snapping a selfie with a fan. Tottenham's Destiny Udogie then bundled in an own goal to complete a miserable afternoon for the visitors who have lost 19 Premier League games this season. Liverpool, who have now matched arch-rivals Manchester United's English titles record, have 82 points from 34 games played with Arsenal a distant second on 67. A rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone — the club's beloved anthem — boomed out after the final whistle with the likes of club greats Kenny Dalglish and Ian Rush joining in. ""This is difficult to put into words,"" Liverpool manager Arne Slot, who replaced Juergen Klopp last year and is the first Dutch coach to win the Premier League, said on the pitch. ""It's more than what I can describe... Everyone said we had already won it but you still feel pressure to get the point over the line."" Slot is only the fifth manager to win the Premier League title in his debut season in English soccer and while it was a formality before kickoff, there was still the small matter of Liverpool ensuring the cake was iced in front of their fans. Five years ago, when Klopp's Liverpool ended a 30-year wait for a 19th title, the Covid pandemic meant a rather anti-climactic finale inside an empty Anfield. Sunday more than made up for that as the fans went through their choir book of club anthems long before kickoff. Sixteenth-placed Tottenham, who made eight changes to their starting line-up with one eye on Thursday's Europa League semi-final, arrived as sacrificial lambs, but momentarily gate-crashed the party as former Liverpool player Solanke headed in James Maddison's corner. Liverpool were only behind for four minutes though. Diaz, appearing in his 100th Premier League game for the club, tapped in Dominik Szoboszlai's low cross and while it was initially disallowed for offside, the decision was overturned after a VAR check to sighs of relief all round. Eight minutes later the party was in full swing as Liverpool took the lead with a special goal by Mac Allister — one of the real unsung heroes in Liverpool's midfield engine room. Tottenham gave possession away trying to play out from the back and when the ball arrived at the feet of the Argentine World Cup winner he thumped a left-footed shot high beyond Vicario. With the visitors now fully complying with their role as props in Liverpool's parade, the hosts began to run riot as Gakpo slammed in his side's third goal after 34 minutes. All that was left to complete a perfect day was a goal for Egyptian Kop idol Salah, and he duly obliged after the break with a trademark finish after cutting in from the right and belting a shot past Vicario. ""It's special and something we don't ever take for granted,"" captain Virgil van Dijk said. ""Lots of emotions today, we are truly the deserved champions."" After a season of domination in which Liverpool have suffered two defeats in 34 league games, no one was arguing."

Gladiators registered their fourth win of the PSL 10 with a resounding 10-wicket triumph over Sultans. Chasing a modest target of 90 runs, the Gladiators got off to a flying start, with opener Finn Allen taking the attack to David Willey in the second over, smashing two sixes and a four for 17 runs to set the tone early. Skipper Saud Shakeel provided solid support, adding timely boundaries to maintain momentum. The openers reached 38-0 in just four overs and brought up their 50-run partnership shortly after, easing the pressure on the chase. By the end of the powerplay, Quetta had raced to 74-0, showcasing sheer dominance. The Gladiators crossed the finish line with 79 deliveries to spare, as Allen launched a six off Usama Mir to seal the victory. Allen remained unbeaten on 45 off 21 deliveries, while Saud Shakeel scored an impressive 42* off just 20 balls. This victory marked the first time in PSL history that Quetta Gladiators won a match by 10 wickets. Earlier, Multan Sultans endured a nightmare start after opting to bat. Opener Yasir Khan was dismissed by Khurram Shahzad for five, and Usman Khan followed for a second-ball duck in the same over, leaving the side reeling at 7-2. Khurram continued his fiery spell, removing Kamran Ghulam (3) and Curtis Campher (4) in his next over to leave the Sultans tottering at 20-4 within the first four overs. Captain Mohammad Rizwan and Iftikhar Ahmed tried to stabilize the innings but found no respite. Faheem Ashraf dismissed Iftikhar for six, and then removed Michael Bracewell for a duck, as Multan slumped to 43-6. David Willey was the next to fall, bowled by Mohammad Wasim Jr for seven. Usama Mir was run out for 11 following a brilliant diving effort by Rilee Rossouw, and Kusal Mendis combined with Hassan Nawaz to run out Mohammad Hasnain for two. Rizwan was the lone warrior, scoring 44 runs in a valiant effort. However, he was the last man to fall, bowled by Ubaid Shah, as Multan were bowled out for 89 in 17 overs. For Quetta, Khurram Shahzad was the standout performer with a remarkable four-wicket haul. Faheem Ashraf and Mohammad Wasim Jr claimed two wickets apiece, while Ubaid Shah took the final scalp."

Indian users attempting to access these profiles were met with a message stating: ""Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content."" Among the other Pakistani actors whose accounts are no longer visible in India are Bilal Abbas, Iqra Aziz, Imran Abbas and Sajal Aly. At the same time, the profiles of Fawad Khan and Wahaj Ali remain accessible for now. The restriction follows a wave of digital crackdowns by India in response to the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), which left 26 people dead. India has blamed Pakistan for supporting the militants involved — an allegation Islamabad has strongly denied. This is not the only digital restriction imposed. Indian authorities have also banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels, citing the spread of ""provocative"" or “communally sensitive ” content. The official YouTube channel of former Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Akhtar — with over 3.5 million subscribers — has reportedly also been removed. These measures are part of a broader diplomatic retaliation by India, which has already suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, cut diplomatic staff at its High Commission in Islamabad, and cancelled visas issued to Pakistani nationals. New Delhi linked Islamabad to the attack without offering any evidence and took a flurry of punitive measures to downgrade ties. Islamabad, in response, ordered the expulsion of Indian diplomats and military advisers, cancelling visas for Indian nationals, with the exception of Sikh pilgrims, and closing the main border crossing from its side. Pakistan also offered to take part in a credible and transparent investigation."
Pakistani filmmaker Mo Naqvi earns Emmy nomination for Netflix docuseries,"May 02, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/602841-pakistani-filmmaker-mo-naqvi-earns-emmy-nomination-for-netflix-docuseries-turning-point-the-bomb-the-cold-war,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-02/602841_2877537_updates.jpg,"Acclaimed Pakistani filmmaker Mohammed Ali (Mo) Naqvi has been nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Historical Documentary for 'Turning Point: The Bomb & The Cold War', a globally recognised Netflix series he produced. This marks Naqvi’s fourth Emmy nomination, solidifying his place as one of the most decorated Pakistani filmmakers in Emmy history. In 2023, Naqvi made history as the first Pakistani to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy in the Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking category for The Accused: Damned or Devoted?. He is also the first Pakistani ever to win the coveted Television Academy Honor, which he received in 2008 for his Showtime film Shame. 'Turning Point: The Bomb & The Cold War' is a powerful 9-part documentary series directed by Brian Knappenberger. Filmed over two years across seven countries, the series explores the roots and aftershocks of the Cold War and their connection to today’s global crises. It features exclusive interviews with global leaders including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, former CIA Director Robert Gates, and former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The show became an instant global success on Netflix, reaching #3 in the Netflix Original Series chart, with more than 621 million minutes streamed in its first few weeks. In addition to his Emmy recognition, Naqvi is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Chairman of the Pakistan Academy Selection Committee, and co-founder of the Crescent Collective, which launched Pakistan’s official presence at the Cannes Film Festival in partnership with Global Lens Day and the American Pavilion. Naqvi was recently named a 2025 Concordia Fellow by Concordia Studio, the Oscar-winning production company founded by Davis Guggenheim, as part of a global cohort of visionary documentary filmmakers. The fellowship recognizes filmmakers pushing boundaries and amplifying underrepresented voices in non-fiction cinema. Speaking to Geo.tv , Mo Naqvi said he was immediately drawn to ‘Turning Point: The Bomb & The Cold War’ after being invited to join the project by Luminant Media and director Brian Knappenberger, calling it a rare opportunity to contribute to a Netflix global original while exploring pivotal historical events with a committed team. Referring to the docuseries, Naqvi said that the series does not merely recount Cold War events but confronts them, aiming to challenge dominant narratives and uncover the ways powerful actors shaped modern global realities. ""As a co-executive producer, I had the extraordinary privilege of researching and uncovering some of the Cold War’s darkest chapters,"" he said. The filmmaker highlighted specific examples, such as the CIA’s involvement in the 1953 coup against Iran’s Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, which he noted was orchestrated to protect British oil interests and had long-term destabilising consequences. He also pointed to US-backed regime changes in Guatemala and support for proxy wars as part of a broader Cold War strategy with lingering effects in regions like Ukraine, Latin America, and South Asia. ""For me, this series is a reminder that history isn’t in the past — it’s the blueprint for our present,"" he said. Speaking on his Emmy recognition, Naqvi clarified that this nomination is his fifth, including the Television Academy Honor he received in 2008 for Shame. He described each nomination as both a personal achievement and a broader symbol of the growing recognition of Pakistani voices in global media. ""I see my role not just as a filmmaker, but as a space-maker — someone working to carve out room for more of us to be seen, heard, and valued on the world stage,"" he said. Naqvi expressed hope that his work might help shift narratives and open doors for emerging Pakistani storytellers, adding, ""If it opens a door for another young storyteller from Pakistan — then every frame has been worth it."""

The celebrities said Pakistan does not believe in initiating conflict, but if provoked, the country will defend itself strongly. “Our desire for peace should not be mistaken for weakness,” they added. The reactions came after suspected militants killed at least 26 tourists in the April 22 attack on the mountain destination in IIOJK. India has accused Pakistan of involvement in the attack, which Islamabad denies. Pakistan said it has ""credible intelligence"" that India intends to launch military action. Following the attack, India suspended the 65-year-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in a bitter response to Pakistan. Responding swifly, Pakistan also announced retaliatory measures that have included halting all border trade, closing its airspace to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats. Islamabad has also warned that any attempt to prevent the flow of river water promised under a decades-old treaty between the two nations would be considered an act of war. Pakistan not only condemned the Pahalgam incident, but Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered full cooperation for a neutral investigation if India is willing. Despite this, Indian officials have continued issuing threats of action against Pakistan. However, Pakistan’s civil and military leadership has made it clear that any misadventure will be met with a memorable response. Meanwhile, India has reportedly taken down social media accounts of several Pakistani politicians, government officials, and celebrities from the entertainment and sports world. Instagram accounts of several celebrities, including Hania Aamir, Mahira Khan, Ali Zafar, and Sanam Saeed, are blocked from view in India, Geo.tv reported.

After the attack, all posts related to the film has been removed from Kapoor’s Instagram account including posters, teasers, and photos with the Pakistani star. As per NDTV report, Vaani Kapoor did not delete the posts herself but the film’s production team did. The content was originally shared as Instagram collaboration, therefore, deletion by the production team automatically removed posts from her profile. Abir Gulaal was set to release on May 9. It was a romantic drama directed by Aarti S Bagdi and produced by Vivek Agrawal. However, Indian government reportedly denied permission for release after the Pahalgam attack as the movie included Pakistani star Fawad Khan. Additionally, prior to the Pahalgam attacks, Abir Gulaal faced opposition from right-wing political factions in India. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) objected to the film’s release in Maharashtra. MNS spokesperson Ameya Khopkar said his party would not allow the film to be screened in the state due to a Pakistani actor’s involvement. Moreover, Fawad Khan, like many other Pakistani actors, condemned the attack. In an Instagram story posted, he wrote: “Deeply saddened to hear the news of the heinous attack in Pahalgam. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this horrifying incident, and we pray for strength and healing for their families in this difficult time.”"

On social media, India banned dozens of Pakistani YouTube channels, including Pakistani news outlets. On Saturday, further restrictions blocked access in India to the Instagram account of Pakistan's ex-prime minister and cricket captain Imran Khan. Bollywood movie regulars Fawad Khan and Atif Aslam were also off limits, as well as a wide range of cricketers — including star batters Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan and retired players Shahid Afridi and Wasim Akram. Olympic gold medallist Arshad Nadeem's Instagram account was also no longer accessible to Indian users, reflecting the broad scope of the clampdown beyond just cricket. The Instagram accounts of several prominent Pakistani celebrities, including Hania Aamir, Mahira Khan, Ali Zafar, and Sanam Saeed, have been blocked from view in India.

Users in India attempting to access these accounts are shown a message indicating that they are unavailable due to compliance with a legal request. A day earlier, Pakistan's military said it carried out a ""training launch"" of a surface-to-surface missile weapons system on Saturday, further heightening tensions. The arch-rivals had already expelled each other's citizens and closed the main border crossing, and barred aircraft from each other's airspace. — With additional input from AFP"

Meanwhile, actor Ayeza Khan shared an old video of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah giving a speech in which he declared that every citizen of Pakistan, irrespective of their religion, is free to worship in their own places of worship. ""You are all free to go to your temples, you are all free to go to your mosques, and to go to any other place of worship, no matter what religion you belong to in this country of Pakistan...,"" the founder of Pakistan said in the video as he gave a speech. Ayeza captioned the post: ""Pakistan Zindabad. We have shown great strength bravely, calmly, and unitedly in this current situation. May Allah bless humanity, and may peace prevail above all"". This strong condemnation comes after India launched 24 attacks on six sites in Pakistan earlier on Wednesday — all targets hit were civilian, with most being mosques — with Indian munitions also causing damage to the surrounding residential structures. The targeted sites included Kotli, Bahawalpur, Muridke, Bagh and Muzaffarabad. The attack on civilians left eight Pakistanis martyred and 35 injured. According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director-General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, Pakistan gave a timely and befitting response to Indian aggression in the dark and destroyed Indian Air Force (IAF) jets, including three French-made Rafales, one Su30MKI and one MIG-29 Fulcrum. The Pakistan Armed Forces destroyed the Indian brigade headquarters and a checkpost along the Line of Control (LoC), with the DG ISPR confirming that all Pakistan Air Force jets are safe after engaging Indian jets. Veteran actor Fawad Khan also sent condolences to the families of those martyred and injured in this shameful attack. ""My deepest condolences to the families of those injured and killed in this shameful attack,"" Fawad wrote on his Instagram Story. ""I pray for the souls of the deceased and strength for their loved ones in the days to come."" ""A respectful request to all: stop stoking the flames with ramble-rousing words. It is not worth the lives of innocent people. May better sense prevail,"" he added. Other celebrities who condemned the attack included actors Fahad Mustafa, Hina Altaf, Hina Khwaja Bayat, Minal Khan, and Ushna Shah among others. Some celebrities also shared prayers for the Pakistan Armed Forces and the ones who were martyred in the attack."

Citing an AICWA press release, NDTV reported that the group accused Mahira Khan of calling India’s military action “seriously cowardly” and blamed Fawad Khan for “supporting divisive narratives” and failing to condemn terrorism. Following the attacks, Pakistani celebrities took to social media, expressing strong condemnation of India's actions, describing them as ""cowardly"". Mahira took to her Instagram Story to write: ""Seriously cowardly!!! May Allah protect our country, may better sense prevail. Ameen"" ""You attack cities, in the middle of the night and call it a victory? Shame on you,"" Mahira wrote in a separate post on Instagram. Fawad Khan also sent condolences to the families of those martyred and injured in this shameful attack.

The association termed their remarks as ""disrespectful to the Indian nation"" and ""an insult to the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country"". ""No Indian artist will collaborate with any Pakistani talent, nor will any global platform be shared with them,"" according to the association’s statement. This tirade by the AICWA comes a day after India launched strikes on Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir in the dead of the night, an assault that Islamabad called a ""blatant act of war"" as tension spirals between the nuclear-armed rivals. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), six Pakistani locations, from mosques to hydropower projects, were targeted, martyring 31 civilians and wounding 57 others. The Pakistan armed forces also destroyed multiple enemy posts in several sectors along the Line of Control (LoC). The association also criticised Indian music labels and performers for working with Pakistani artists internationally, calling these collaborations ""a betrayal of national pride."" AICWA criticised the film Abir Gulal for casting Fawad Khan, saying it was ""a disgrace to the sacrifices made by our brave soldiers,"" referring to the 2019 Pulwama attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). AICWA has made similar calls to ban Pakistani artists in the past, including in 2016 and 2019, after cross-border tensions."

Such behaviour seriously dented the credibility and integrity of the Indian media. Outlandish claims, from the destruction of Karachi port to the levelling of Islamabad, have been peddled on live TV by some of the biggest news channels of the country. The clownery reached such a level that even Indian celebrities and Youtubers called them out for blatantly lying and misleading the public. Bollywood actor Sonakshi Sinha showed irritation over their dramatised visuals and sound effects by calling the coverage from the channels a ‘joke’. “Just do your job, report facts as they are. Stop sensationalising WAR and creating panic among people… for gods sake,” Sinha said on her Instagram story. She further advised Indians to find a reliable news sources and stick to that, adding, “stop watching this garbage in the name of news”. She was joined by another Indian television actress, Tejasswi Prakash, who slammed Indian mainstream media in a post on her X account where she shared a clip from the country’s news channel. In the video, the reporter was telling that no Pakistani aircraft entered Indian airspace, which was immediately interrupted by the anchor to spread fake news, pushing the usual narrative of the BJP-led government. She said, “This is exactly why I don’t trust this Godi Media anymore. It’s not journalism — it’s scripted propaganda”. “Blind nationalism is not patriotism. Question what you are being shown,” she asked Indian citizens. Dhruv Rathee, a popular Indian content creator with around 29 million YouTube subscribers, shared a video of Major Gaurav Arya on his X account, saying, “block these frauds from your Twitter accounts.” “Never watch these fake news channels again. Share with your family members also,” he added. While Nitish Rajput, another popular Indian YouTuber with around 7 million subscribers, sarcastically called out Indian mainstream media, saying, “If the news media tells me it is raining, I will look for my sunglasses.” The latest escalation in the decades-old Pakistan-India rivalry began on May 7 when at least 31 civilians were killed in an unprovoked Indian cross-border attack. In retaliation, Pakistan downed five IAF fighter jets, including three Rafales, and dozens of drones. Meanwhile, India continues to send drones into Pakistani territory, with the military shooting down nearly 80, including Israeli-made IAI Heron — medium-altitude, long-endurance — unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)."
India sees 64 hate speech events in 14 days after Pahalgam attack: report,"May 04, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603091-india-sees-64-hate-speech-events-in-14-days-after-pahalgam-attack,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-04/603091_7848061_updates.jpg,"A report by the India Hate Lab (IHL) has documented 64 in-person hate speech events held across nine Indian states and the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) between April 22 and May 2, with Maharashtra recording the highest number, The News reported, citing Indian media. These incidents occurred in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack and were part of what the report described as a coordinated nationwide campaign of hate and intimidation targeting Muslims, spearheaded by Hindu far-right groups. The IHL report noted that most of the rallies were organised by Hindu nationalist organisations, including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Bajrang Dal, Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad (AHP), Rashtriya Bajrang Dal (RBD), Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, Sakal Hindu Samaj, Hindu Rashtra Sena, and the Hindu Raksha Dal. “These groups are exploiting the tragedy to inflame communal tensions and mobilise calls for violence, social exclusion, and economic boycotts,” stated the report. Among the states, Maharashtra recorded the highest number with 17 incidents, followed by Uttar Pradesh (13), Uttarakhand (6), Haryana (6), Rajasthan (5), Madhya Pradesh (5), Himachal Pradesh (5), Bihar (4), and Chhattisgarh (2). The report states that speakers at these events routinely used dehumanising language, referring to Muslims as “green snakes"", ""keede"" (insects), and “mad dogs.” It also notes that in many instances, speakers incited violence and issued threats to expel Muslims from localities. According to the report, between April 23 and 29, multiple hate speech events took place across states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, and Maharashtra. Far-right figures, including BJP MLA Nandkishor Gurjar and members of Hindu nationalist groups, used dehumanising slurs for Muslims, called for their economic and social boycott, incited violence, and urged Hindus to arm themselves. In several rallies, speakers threatened to expel Muslims and spread conspiracy theories linking them to Pakistan and Bangladesh. The report noted that the wave of hate speech has been accompanied by a troubling rise in hate crimes and violence targeting Muslims —particularly Kashmiris — citing incidents such as the assault and arson of Muslim street vendors in Haryana, attacks on Kashmiri shawl sellers, and threats by a BJP leader in Uttarakhand, as well as the brutal axe attack on a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh, where the assailant reportedly shouted, “Twenty-six were killed; twenty-six of yours will die too.” IHL researchers have observed that most of these in-person hate speech events were either live-streamed or recorded and uploaded to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, or X, significantly amplifying their impact and extending their reach to millions of viewers. “The rapid spread of this content demonstrates the dangerous connection between online hate ecosystems and offline violence,” they said."

In a statement on Telegram, the Kremlin said that Xi will discuss with Russian President Vladimir Putin the development of the two countries' strategic partnership, as well as signing a number of documents. ""During the talks, the main issues of further development of relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction, as well as current issues on the international and regional agenda will be discussed,"" the Kremlin said. The Soviet Union lost 27 million people in World War Two but pushed Nazi forces back to Berlin, where Hitler committed suicide and the red Soviet Victory Banner was raised over the Reichstag in 1945. Several other national leaders are expected at the celebrations, including the presidents of Brazil and Serbia, and the prime minister of Slovakia. Putin has proposed a three day ceasefire with Ukraine around the May 9 celebration, one of the most important in the Russian calendar. Responding to Moscow's offer of the three-day ceasefire, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was ready as long as the ceasefire would be 30 days in length, something Putin had already ruled out in the near term, saying he wants a long-term settlement not a brief pause. Zelenskiy said Ukraine, given the continued war with Russia, could not guarantee the safety of any foreign dignitaries who came to Moscow for the traditional May 9 victory parade. Zelenskiy has in recent weeks upped criticism of China, which he has said is providing weapons and gunpowder to Russia. Russian state news agency RIA cited Putin, in a documentary film marking 25 years since his first inauguration as Russian president aired on Sunday, as saying that Russia's relations with China were: ""truly strategic in nature, deep-seated"". ""Our national interests coincide"", it quoted him as saying."

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump stated he had authorised the Department of Commerce and the US Trade Representative to begin implementing the measure, citing foreign incentives for film production as a ""national security threat."" Trump blamed countries like the UK, Canada, and Australia for attracting US filmmakers and studios with tax benefits and lower production costs. “It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” he posted. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” While the proposal marks a significant escalation in his ongoing trade-offensives, it has raised alarm across the international entertainment sector. UK media union Bectu called the plan a “knock-out blow” to the global industry and warned it could threaten the livelihoods of tens of thousands of freelancers just recovering from the pandemic and industry slowdown. Experts say the tariffs could disrupt international cooperation in filmmaking, while critics question how such a policy would be implemented. It's still unclear whether the tariffs would apply to American production companies filming abroad or include films distributed through streaming platforms. Timothy Richards, founder of European cinema chain Vue, questioned how US origin would be determined: “Is it where the money comes from? The script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?” Meanwhile, the US Commerce Secretary said, “We’re on it,” though no detailed guidelines have been issued. Other countries, including Australia and New Zealand, have vowed to defend their domestic film sectors. Industry analysts warn the move could trigger retaliatory tariffs and risk further isolating Hollywood from international markets."

India halts Chenab River water flow to Pakistan via Baglihar Dam,"May 05, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603185-india-halts-chenab-river-water-flow-to-pakistan-via-baglihar-dam,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-05/603185_4270867_updates.jpg,"NEW DELHI: India has restricted the water flow from the Baglihar Dam on the Chenab River and is reportedly considering taking similar measures at the Kishanganga Dam on the Jhelum River, The News reported citing Indian media on Monday. The hydroelectric dams — Baglihar in Ramban in Jammu and Kishanganga in north Kashmir — offer India the ability to regulate the timing of water releases, Press Trust of India reported quoting sources familiar with the matter. India’s decision to suspend the decades-old treaty follows the killing of 26 people, mostly tourists, in Pahalgam, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) on April 22. The Indus Waters Treaty, brokered by the World Bank, has governed the use of Indus River and its tributaries between Pakistan and India. The Baglihar Dam has been a longstanding point of contention between the two neighbours, with Pakistan having sought World Bank arbitration in the past. The Kishanganga Dam has faced legal and diplomatic scrutiny, especially regarding its impact on the Neelum River, a tributary of Jhelum river. Both countries are on the brink of an armed conflict, even as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a recent high-level meeting with the top defence brass, asserted that the armed forces have “complete operational freedom” to decide on the mode, targets and timing of India’s response to the terror attack. New Delhi linked Islamabad to the attack without providing any evidence and took a flurry of punitive measures to downgrade ties, including suspending the IWT, revoking visas of Pakistanis, and closing the Wagah-Attari border crossing, among others. Islamabad, in response, ordered the expulsion of Indian diplomats and military advisers, cancelling visas for Indian nationals, with the exception of Sikh pilgrims, and closing the main border crossing from its side. It denied its involvement in the attack and offered to take part in a credible and transparent investigation. Pakistan also shut its airspace to Indian airliners and suspended all trade with India, including through third countries. Rejecting India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, the country said any move to stop the flow of water will be seen as an “act of war”. It may be noted that India has reportedly violate the IWT in the past as well by building at least three dams. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned on Friday that Pakistan would strike if India builds any structure on the Indus River in violation of the water treaty."

""REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ!"" he posted on the Truth Social platform. ""When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm."" The federal prison at Alcatraz housed notorious US criminals such as Al Capone before it closed in 1963. It is now one of San Francisco's most popular tourist destinations. ""Today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ,"" Trump wrote. Trump told reporters as he returned to the White House from Florida, that reopening the prison was ""Just an idea I've had"" and decided to act on. ""It's a symbol of law and order,"" he said. Alcatraz was billed as America's most secure prison given the island location, frigid waters and strong currents. No successful escapes were ever officially recorded from Alcatraz, though five prisoners are listed as ""missing and presumed drowned."" Alcatraz was closed because it was too expensive to continue operating, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) website, opens new tab, in large part due to its island location. It was nearly three times more costly to operate than any other federal prison, the BOP website said. Nancy Pelosi, former House speaker and Democratic lawmaker from California, downplayed the Republican President's plan. ""Alcatraz closed as a federal penitentiary more than sixty years ago. It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction. The President’s proposal is not a serious one,"" she said in a post on X."
Trump denies third term ambitions citing constitutional limits,"May 05, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603197-trump-puts-2028-election-campaign-rumours-to-rest,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-05/603197_7818630_updates.jpg,"United States President Donald Trump has finally addressed the rumours regarding his potential presidential bid in the 2028 election and put them to rest. Speaking in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press that aired on Sunday, Trump dismissed suggestions of seeking a third term in office as he stated that he will adhere to the two-term limit set by the Constitution, the BBC reported. ""I'll be an eight-year president, I'll be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important,"" said Trump during the interview. These remarks follow a history of comments where President Trump had appeared to entertain the possibility of staying in office beyond two terms. He had previously stated that he was ""not joking"" about seeking a third or even fourth term, later claiming these statements were meant to provoke the media. Adding to the speculation, merchandise bearing ""Trump 2028"" has been sold by his organisation. In the recent interview, that took place at his Florida residence, the 78-year-old Republican president acknowledged that he has received numerous requests to consider remaining in office. ""So many people want me to do it,"" he said, just days after marking the first 100 days of his second term. Despite these apparent calls for him to stay, Trump conceded that a third term is likely not possible under the current legal framework. ""It's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do. I don't know if that's constitutional that they're not allowing you to do it or anything else,"" said Trump. He also noted the existence of ""many people selling the 2028 hat"" but reiterated, ""this is not something I'm looking to do."" Trump then mentioned several Republicans, including US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as potential successors. The 22nd Amendment of the Constitution explicitly limits a president to two terms. Amending this would require significant hurdles, including approval by a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, followed by approval from three-quarters of the country's state-level governments. While some of Trump's supporters have reportedly floated theories suggesting potential loopholes in the Constitution, these remain untested and largely unsupported by legal experts. When questioned about whether anyone approached him with such theories, Trump offered a vague response, saying that ""in a capacity of being a big supporter, many people have said different things""."

Hasaan said: “Waseem’s journey, spanning 26 years and over 300 fights, showcases the dedication and perseverance that Dream Beyond is designed to spotlight and support.

The collaboration between Muhammad Waseem and us was born from a longstanding personal connection, underscoring our authentic ties to the community support. Waseem deserves our full support. I call on other businesses to come forward and support talents like Muhammad Waseem.” The boxer from Quetta said he was thankful for the support. He said: “This is much needed support for me at this critical stage of my professional life. I have fought over 300 fights, over 15 world level professional fights. This support means a lot to me.”"

I work hard and am never satisfied with my performance. Even when I've been ranked number one, I always look ahead and think of my country."" Additionally, Babar revealed that decisions about his T20 career rest with the selectors and coaches. ""It's not up to me whether I’m played or rested. My job is to perform — be it T20, ODI or Test cricket. I was told I’m being rested from T20s; let's see what they decide next."" Moreover, he stressed that ODIs becoming irrelevant due to T20s is ""not true"". ""The 50-over format tests your patience, and we now see scores over 350. ODIs have always been special for me, filled with good memories and performances,"" said Babar. Furthermore, the 30-year-old batter emphasised that the PSL is a world-class league and he felt that its graph has not declined. ""Interest may vary from match to match, but overall the quality remains. Foreign players want to participate. The bowling quality here is excellent — each team has bowlers who clock over 145 kph,"" he said. While Babar acknowledged his fans' love and support, he admitted that fan expectations do create pressure. He said: ""Their love and support mean I must perform in front of them. It gives me confidence when fans appreciate me wherever I go. When the crowd chants 'Babar, Babar', I thank Allah for the respect I've received. ""I used to ride a bicycle to the stadium, dreaming of playing there one day. Now the same crowd cheers for me. I remember starting out as a ball picker and later playing as a bowler. I'm truly grateful to Allah and feel a greater responsibility not to let my fans down."" He added that he even enjoys the memes made about him, saying they're a sign of affection from fans."

Chasing a daunting 210-run target, the United’s batting unit unfolded on a meagre 121 before getting bowled out in 16.5 overs and thus succumbed to their first defeat in the ongoing season. The visitors got off to a shaky start to their innings as Shaheen Shah Afridi dismissed in-form opening batter Sahibzada Farhan in the third over with just 11 runs on the board. Following the early hiccup, Salman Ali Agha joined Andries Gous in the middle and together they stitched an anchoring 69-run partnership for the second wicket. The duo appeared to have settled down and was looking to pace things until Sikandar Raza cleaned up Agha in the 10th over. The right-handed batter made 36 off 25 deliveries with the help of two fours and three sixes. Agha’s dismissal sparked a collapse, which saw United losing their remaining eight wickets for just 50 runs and were thus bundled out for a modest total. Opening batter Gous remained the top-scorer for the United with a 27-ball 41, laced with two fours and three sixes. Haris Rauf was the pick of the Qalandars’ bowlers as he took four wickets for just 31 runs in 3.5 overs, followed by Raza with three, while Tom Curran, Asif Afridi and Shaheen chipped in with one scalp apiece. Earlier, explosive late-order knocks from Sam Billings and Sikandar Raza lifted Lahore Qalandars to an imposing 209/6 against the unbeaten Islamabad United. Put into bat first, the Qalandars accumulated 209/6 in their 20 overs, courtesy of a 64-run partnership for the fifth wicket between Billings and Raza. The home side got off to a decent start to their innings as their struggling opening pair of Fakhar Zaman and Mohammad Naeem turned the tide by putting together 50 runs at a brisk rate. Naeem, who was the core aggressor of the stand, had an agonising end to his knock as he got run out on the penultimate delivery of the batting powerplay, courtesy of a direct hit from Ben Dwarshuis. The emerging opener scored 25 off 22 deliveries with the help of four fours and a six. Fakhar was then involved in another crucial partnership for the hosts when he added 47 runs for the second wicket with Abdullah Shafique before falling victim to Imad Wasim in the 11th over. He smashed five fours and two sixes on his way to a 30-ball 44. Imad struck again in his next over by getting another set batter Abdullah Shafique caught at long-off, reducing the Qalandars to 108/3. Shafique made 22 off 17 deliveries, laced with three boundaries. Following the back-to-back blows, wicketkeeper batter Sam Billings and Daryl Mitchell then knitted a blistering 37-run partnership in just 21 deliveries before the latter fell victim to Dwarshuis after scoring 28 off 18 deliveries, comprised of two fours and as many sixes. Billings was then joined by in-form Sikandar Raza in the middle and the duo dominated United’s bowlers at the backend to bolster the hosts’ total. Billings and Raza put together a quickfire 64-run partnership for the sixth wicket, which culminated with the latter’s dismissal on the penultimate delivery of the innings. Raza smashed three fours and as many sixes on his way to a 17-ball 39. Billings, on the other hand, batted until the end and returned unbeaten with a 17-ball 38, studded with one four and four sixes. For United, Imad and Jason Holder bagged two wickets each, while Dwarshuis chipped in with one strike. Earlier, Islamabad United won the toss and elected to bowl first against Lahore Qalandars.

Chasing a daunting target of 205, Multan had a nightmare start as skipper Mohammad Rizwan fell for a second-ball duck in the second over, dismissed by Abbas Afridi with the score at just 3-1. The next over saw Mir Hamza strike, removing wicketkeeper-batter Usman Khan for only one run. The Sultans’ top order crumbled under pressure, with Yasir Khan — who showed brief resistance with a 26-run knock off 17 balls — becoming the third wicket to fall inside the powerplay, leaving the side struggling at 34-3 in 4.2 overs. Only Kamran Ghulam offered any stability in the middle order, remaining unbeaten for most of the innings and scoring 28 runs. However, the rest of the batting lineup failed to step up. Curtis Campher delivered key blows, dismissing Mohammad Nabi (12) and Iftikhar Ahmed (8), reducing Multan to 76-5 in 10.2 overs. Michael Bracewell (2) and David Willey (0) offered no resistance, as the collapse continued with Multan reeling at 85-7 by the 11.4-over mark. Khushdil Shah then removed the set batter Kamran Ghulam, further denting Sultans' hopes at 88-8 in 12.4 overs. Mohammad Nabi wrapped up the tail by taking his third wicket, dismissing Usama Mir for just 1 run. Mir Hamza claimed the final wicket of Ubaid Shah (14), sealing Multan’s fate with just one win from eight matches in the tournament. Earlier, Karachi Kings opted to bat first and got off to a flying start, thanks to aggressive hitting from openers Tim Seifert and captain David Warner. Though Ubaid Shah brought a brief respite by dismissing Omair Bin Yousuf for 1 with the score at 58-3, Irfan Khan Niazi and James Vince built a crucial fourth-wicket partnership. By the 12th over, Karachi had recovered to 112-3, with Niazi unbeaten on 39 and Vince on 33. The pair added 78 runs before Curtis Campher ended the stand, dismissing Niazi for 40 off 33 balls, leaving the Kings at 138-4 in 14.5 overs. James Vince continued his fine run of form in PSL 10, bringing up another half-century to push Karachi to 155-4 after 17 overs. He was joined by Khushdil Shah, who made an immediate impact with a blistering cameo. The Kings added 16 runs in the final over, finishing at an impressive 204-4. Vince remained unbeaten on 65, while Khushdil hammered 33 off just 13 balls, setting the stage for a dominant win.

Gauff and Swiatek had met 14 times, with the head-to-head heavily in four-time French Open winner Swiatek's favour at 11 wins to 3, while the American had never beaten the Pole on clay. Swiatek's frustration mounted as Gauff stormed back from 0–1 to win 11 straight games and 12 of the last 13. Visibly rattled, the top seed lost her composure and was even hit with a rare code violation for an audible obscenity. ""Honestly, there's nothing to walk through because it was all pretty much the same from the beginning to the end,"" world number two Swiatek told reporters. ""I couldn't really get my level up. Coco played good, but, yeah, I think it's on me that I didn't really move well, I wasn't ready to play back the shots with heaviness, and with that kind of game like it was pretty bad."" Two-time champion Sabalenka claimed a straight-sets victory over Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 6-3 7-5 to reach her third consecutive final in Madrid. The Belarusian delivered a dominant performance and appeared to be cruising to victory after breaking early in the second set and serving for a 5-4 lead. Yet 17th seed Svitolina broke back in what seemed a momentum shift, before Sabalenka responded immediately, breaking again to seal the win in just over 90 minutes. ""It's hard to beat Svitolina, it was a very tough battle,"" said the 26-year-old as she reached her fifth final of the year. ""But I'm very happy to reach the final. (Svitolina) makes you fight every point, to beat her you have to play your best tennis. And winning it gives you great confidence and means you're in good shape."" Earlier in the day, Briton fifth seed Jack Draper booked his place in the semi-finals with a commanding 6-0 6-4 win over Italy's Matteo Arnaldi, setting up a clash with 10th seed Lorenzo Musetti, who eased past Canada's Gabriel Diallo 6-4 6-3. Argentine Francisco Cerundolo also progressed, rallying from a set down to beat Czech teenager Jakub Mensik 3-6 7-6(5) 6-2 and will face Casper Ruud, who stunned ninth seed Daniil Medvedev 6-3 7-5, for a place in the final."

Qalandars and Gladiators, placed second and third respectively, had the opportunity to end defending champions Islamabad United’s stronghold at the top of the standings but the two former champions had to settle down for a point apiece. As a result, Qalandars and Gladiators remained second and third respectively with nine points each. Qalandars next face Karachi Kings on Sunday, while Gladiators’ next match is scheduled against holders United on Saturday. Put into bat first, the Qalandars could accumulate 111/3 in their 11.3 overs as a severe dust storm hit the Gaddafi Stadium here, causing the action to stop. The dust storm was followed by light yet steady rain which eventually resulted in the match being called off. The Qalandars, batting first, had an unwanted start to their innings as Khurram Shahzad cleaned up their experienced opener Fakhar Zaman for a duck on just the third delivery of the innings. Following the early hiccup, Abdullah Shafique joined Mohammad Naeem and together they raised an astounding recovery by putting together a century-plus stand. The duo added 102 runs for the second wicket until Naeem eventually fell victim to Abrar Ahmed. He scored 50 off 30 deliveries, laced with three fours and four sixes. Abrar struck again in his next over, dismissing Daryl Mitchell on three and had consequently reduced the Qalandars to 111/3 in 11.3 overs until a dust storm intervened in the action. Abdullah Shafique remained unbeaten with a 32-ball 53, studded with three fours and as many sixes. For Gladiators, Abrar picked up two wickets, while Shahzad made one strike."

Chasing a modest target of 144, Zalmi got off to an explosive start when Mitchell Owen launched a straight six off the very first ball of Kyle Mayers’ spell. However, Mayers struck back immediately, dismissing Owen on the next delivery and bringing captain Babar Azam to the crease alongside Saim Ayub. Ben Dwarshuis struck in the following over, removing Saim Ayub for just one, leaving Zalmi in early trouble at 12-2 after 1.2 overs. Babar Azam and Mohammad Haris then added 26 runs for the third wicket before Haris was dismissed by Riley Meredith for 13 off 12 balls. Zalmi found stability as Babar and debutant Maaz Sadaqat stitched together a crucial 50-run stand for the fourth wicket, taking the team to 93-3 by the end of the 12th over. Maaz played a sensational knock in his first PSL outing, reaching a well-earned half-century and accelerating the chase alongside his captain. Babar Azam also brought up his 35th PSL fifty in style, maintaining a solid anchor role throughout the innings. With just four runs needed to win, Naseem Shah returned to the attack and broke the 100-run partnership by dismissing Maaz for a brilliant 55 off 33 balls. However, Zalmi completed the chase in the 17th over, with Babar finishing unbeaten on 53 off 49 deliveries, and Max Bryant hitting the winning runs. Earlier, Islamabad United posted a total of 143 for 9 in their allotted 20 overs, with a late fireworks from Ben Dwarshuis helping them recover after a batting collapse against Peshawar Zalmi. Opting to bat first, Islamabad United made a promising start, with openers Sahibzada Farhan and Kyle Mayers providing early momentum. The duo built a solid 50-run partnership, taking the attack to Zalmi’s bowlers with an aggressive approach. However, Zalmi broke through after the powerplay when pacer Ahmed Daniyal dismissed Farhan for 36 off 35 balls, leaving United at 58-1 in 8.4 overs. In the very next over, Mohammad Ali struck, removing Mayers for 18 off 18 deliveries, reducing Islamabad to 62-2 in 9.1 overs. Zalmi continued to make inroads as spinner Saim Ayub removed Agha Salman, who managed just four off seven balls in the 11th over. Captain Shadab Khan then looked to counterattack, hitting consecutive boundaries alongside Colin Munro as the pair added 22 runs for the fourth wicket. However, both were dismissed in quick succession. Shadab scored 15 off 8 balls before being sent back, while Munro followed soon after for 11, leaving United at 89-4 in 12.5 overs. Mohammad Ali continued his impressive spell by removing Saad Masood for just one run, completing a three-wicket haul and reducing United to 91-6 in 14 overs. The collapse continued as Luke Wood dismissed Azam Khan for eight off seven balls, leaving the side struggling at 107-7 in 16.1 overs. Imad Wasim and Ben Dwarshuis attempted to steady the innings with some crucial late runs, but their resistance didn’t last long. A brilliant direct hit from Babar Azam ran out Imad for 10, bringing Islamabad down to 124-8 in the 18th over. Zalmi’s tight bowling and sharp fielding ensured Islamabad couldn’t recover, eventually restricting them to a below-par 134-9. Dwarshuis remained unbeaten with a vital 33 off 17 deliveries, while Naseem Shah contributed just one run before being dismissed on the final ball.

The tournament was originally scheduled to take place in Islamabad from May 29 to June 4. However, following concerns raised by multiple teams, CAVA shifted the event while keeping the dates unchanged. The decision was finalised during CAVA’s Annual General Meeting on April 25 in Nepal, where member nations cited the strained environment between Pakistan and India as the primary reason for their hesitation. “The tournament will be shifted to Uzbekistan, but the dates will remain the same,” a CAVA official said. Ch Mohammad Yaqub, a senior official of the Pakistan Volleyball Federation, confirmed the development. “Yes, the change was made because countries declined to participate due to the security situation between Pakistan and India,” he said. The event will now feature teams from Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and India."

By the third round, Singh was visibly shaken and struggling to stay on his feet under the pressure of Afridi’s aggressive combinations. As the fourth round began, the referee stepped in shortly after noting Bawa's inability to defend himself effectively, awarding the bout to Afridi by TKO. The win marked a significant milestone in Afridi’s career, who now boasts an impressive professional record of 16 wins from 18 fights, with only one loss and one draw. The bout was part of an international ranking event, and Afridi’s victory has further cemented his reputation in the middleweight division.

Chasing a 158-run target, the Gladiators clinched victory on the penultimate delivery of the innings when Nawaz smashed Muhammad Shahzad for a match-winning six. The Gladiators got off to a brisk start as their opening pair, skipper Saud Shakeel and Finn Allen, put together 28 runs inside the first three overs. However, both openers fell in quick succession. Allen, the more aggressive of the two, scored 20, while Saud managed just 7 off 8 deliveries. After the early blows, Rilee Rossouw and Nawaz stabilised the innings with a 52-run partnership. The duo looked composed until a mix-up in running between the wickets brought an end to Rossouw’s gritty knock. He departed for 27 off 24 balls, which included four boundaries. His dismissal triggered a mini-collapse, with the Gladiators losing four wickets in quick succession, slumping to 117/7 by the 16th over. Nawaz then found support in Mohammad Wasim Jr, adding a vital 26-run partnership. Wasim fell on the last ball of the 19th over, leaving 15 runs required off the final over. Hasan, now the lone set batter, rode his luck — getting lifelines on the first two deliveries of the final over — before dispatching Shahzad for a six. Though he failed to connect with the fourth delivery, another dropped catch allowed him to steal two runs. He eventually made the most of his reprieves by launching Shahzad over deep backward square for a six to seal a dramatic win for the Gladiators. Nawaz was the standout performer with an unbeaten 64 off 41 balls, including two fours and four sixes. For Islamabad United, Naseem Shah and Salman Irshad picked up two wickets each, while Mohammad Nawaz, Jason Holder, and Salman Ali Agha claimed one apiece. Ealrier, Islamabad United set a 158-run target for Quetta Gladiators. Put into bat first, the defending champions accumulated 157/9 in their allotted 20 overs. The holders, however, had a contrasting start to their innings as their new opening pair of Sahibzada Farhan and Kyle Mayers laid a solid foundation by putting together a brisk 58-run partnership. The opening stand culminated in the sixth over when Abrar Ahmed gave Gladiators a much-needed breakthrough by cleaning up Mayers, who scored 22 off 17 deliveries with the help of three fours and a six. Faheem then inflicted two more blows to the United’s batting expedition as he removed Colin Munro (nine) and stand-in captain Salman Ali Agha (zero) in his first over. United suffered another massive blow when set batter Sahibzada Farhan fell victim to Gladiators captain Saud Shakeel. He remained the top-scorer for the United with a 24-ball 39, laced with two fours and four sixes. With United reeling at 77/4 in 9.5 overs, Mohammad Nawaz and Andries Gous attempted to anchor the innings but could only put together 14 runs as Faheem made a twin strike again, dismissing the wicketkeeper batter and Muhammad Shahzad. The back-to-back blows had further reduced the United to 91/6 in 13 overs. Following the slump, Haider Ali joined Mohammad Nawaz in the middle and together they raised a valiant 39-run partnership for the seventh wicket. Nawaz was the core aggressor of the stand, while Haider played a supportive role with his eight-ball 10 until falling victim to Khurram Shahzad in the 18th over. The left-handed batter, on the other hand, fell victim to Kyle Jamieson in the final over after top-scoring for the United with a 34-ball 49, comprised of one four and five sixes. He was also involved in a crucial 26-run partnership for the eighth wicket with Jason Holder, who made an unbeaten 14 off 11 deliveries. Faheem Ashraf was the standout bowler for the Gladiators, taking four wickets for just 25 runs in his three overs. He was supported by Khurram, Abrar, Saud and Jamieson, who made one scalp apiece."

Sabalenka, who has played the last three finals of the WTA 1000 tournament, equalled Petra Kvitova's record haul of three Madrid Open titles. She also caught up with Gauff in head-to-head, with five wins apiece after 10 meetings.

Gauff broke Sabalenka to go 2-1 up in the second set and held under pressure to build a 5-3 lead. But Gauff's double faults while serving for the set allowed Sabalenka to break back and make it 5-5 before winning the title in a tiebreak. ""Incredible tournament, you're always tough to face... congratulations on all the success that you're having,"" Gauff told Sabalenka. ""Hopefully I can be back in this position next year."""
PSL 10: Niazi's late blitz powers Kings to victory over Qalandars in rain-reduced thriller,"May 04, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603115-psl-10-karachi-kings-win-toss-opt-to-bowl-first-against-lahore-qalandars,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-04/603115_534325_updates.jpg,"LAHORE: Karachi Kings edged past Lahore Qalandars in a rain-shortened PSL 10 clash, thanks to a late blitz from Irfan Niazi, who guided his side to a thrilling victory in the 24th match of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) 10 at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday. Chasing a revised 168-run target in 15 overs as per the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method, the Kings knocked the winning runs for the loss of six wickets and three balls to spare. The visitors got off to a flamboyant start to their innings as their opening pair of skipper David Warner and Tim Seifert put together a brisk 40-run partnership in just three overs. Haris Rauf, however, broke the threatening stand on the first delivery of his spell by castling David Warner, who scored 24 off 13 deliveries with the help of two fours and as many sixes. Seifert was then involved in a brief 17-run partnership with James Vince until Asif Afridi dismissed him in the fifth over. The New Zealand international made a 10-ball 24, featuring four fours and a six. Coming out to bat at number four, Saad Baig kept the Kings in the hunt with a brisk 25-run cameo from 15 deliveries, laced with three fours and a six. He also shared two important partnerships with James Vince (13) and Muhammad Irfan Khan before falling victim to Daryl Mitchell. The Kings then suffered another blow to their pursuit as Rauf struck again to dismiss Khushidl Shah (nine), bringing the total down to 116/5 in 11.2 overs. With Kings needing 52 runs off 22 deliveries, Irfan turned the game on its head with belligerent hitting and steered the 2020 champions to a sensational victory with an unbeaten 48 off 21 deliveries, studded with two fours and five sixes. He also shared a match-defining 45-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Mohammad Nabi, who contributed with an eight-ball 15 before falling victim to Mitchell on the first delivery of the final over. For Qalandars, Mitchell and Rauf bagged two wickets each, while Asif Afridi and Rishad Hossain made one strike apiece. Earlier, explosive half-centuries from Fakhar Zaman and Mohammad Naeem powered Lahore Qalandars to 160-run total against Karachi Kings. Put to bat first, Qalandars posted a competitive 160/8 in their allotted 15 overs after the match was shortened due to a rain delay of over an hour. The Qalandars started aggressively, with openers Mohammad Naeem and Fakhar Zaman stitching together a blazing 90-run partnership within the first eight overs. Naeem, the more dominant of the two, top-scored with a fiery 29-ball 65, which included six fours and five sixes, before falling to Aamir Jamal — who had earlier dropped him on 11. Soon after Naeem’s dismissal, rain interrupted play and delayed proceedings for more than an hour, reducing the contest to 15 overs per side. Once play resumed, Lahore attempted to regain momentum as Fakhar and Abdullah Shafique added 31 runs. Shafique contributed a quick 18 off 11 before falling to Abbas Afridi, who then removed Daryl Mitchell on the very next ball. The Kings capitalised on the pressure, as Sam Billings departed cheaply, scoring just 2 off 3 against Mir Hamza. Fakhar Zaman went on to score a solid 33-ball 51, featuring four boundaries and three sixes, before he and Sikandar Raza fell to Abbas in the penultimate over. Abbas Afridi was the pick of the bowlers for Karachi Kings, claiming 4 for 27 in his three overs, while Aamir Jamal and Mir Hamza picked up a wicket each. Earlier, Karachi Kings won the toss and elected to bowl first against Lahore Qalandars. Squads Karachi Kings: David Warner (c), Abbas Afridi, James Vince, Hasan Ali (VC), Khushdil Shah, Shan Masood, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Aamir Jamal, Arafat Minhas, Tim Seifert, Zahid Mahmood, Mir Hamza, Shahnawaz Dahani, Riazullah, Omair Bin Yousuf, Kane Williamson, Saad Baig, Mohammad Nabi, Mirza Mamoon and Ben McDermott.

Nottinghamshire head coach hails pacer Mohammad Abbas,"May 04, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603153-nottinghamshire-head-coach-hails-pacer-mohammad-abbas,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-04/603153_1052721_updates.jpg,"NOTTINGHAM: Nottinghamshire CCC head coach Peter Moores has expressed his excitement over the signing of experienced Pakistani fast bowler Mohammad Abbas for this year's county championship, calling him a player who “brings consistency, control, and a deep love for the game”. Speaking to Geo News at Trent Bridge Nottingham, Peter Moores lauded Abbas’s ability to bowl economical spells, swinging the balls rather way on all types of tracks. “Mohammad Abbas is a very good new-ball bowler who creates a lot of pressure and gives you control in the game. That’s the role he knows really well, and I’m looking forward to getting him going,” Abbas, 34, will play for Nottinghamshire in six county championship matches in division one. He is set to join Notts in May as part of their red ball squad for three championship games and will return to Trent Bridge again in September for three more matches at the closing stage of the championship. He said the club had been tracking Abbas for several years, even coming close to signing him earlier. “Mo has got lots of qualities, and I think we’ve watched him in county cricket over several years now. He’s always bowled well against us,” Moores said. “It’s actually funny – we identified him a few years ago and nearly signed him, but it didn’t come off. So for Abbas to finally get to Trent Bridge and play for us is exciting.” Abbas, known for his ability to swing the ball both ways and maintain tight lines, is seen as a direct replacement for Aussie pacer Fergus O’Neill, who is set to leave after Nottinghamshire’s fourth game of the season. Abbas has represented Pakistan in 27 test matches claiming exactly 100 wickets. In December 2024 he was recalled to the national duties for the tour of South Africa after a gap of three years. In the two-match series, he grabbed 10 wickets including 6/54 in the first test. Beyond his on-field contributions, Moores emphasised Abbas’s experience and character as key assets. “Anybody with that sort of international experience offers a lot. Every time I’ve spoken to him, he’s shown he’s a real student of the game and he loves it. Players like him not only have great experience, but they’re often happy to share that knowledge with others — and that’s something we’re definitely looking forward to.” Abbas, who last played a Test for Pakistan in March, is currently preparing for his stint with Nottinghamshire and is expected to join the squad in the first week of May. “He’s already training, doing his stuff, and getting ready,” said Moores. “He’ll have about a week or so with us before he gets going. Interestingly, his first game will be against his old county, Hampshire — so that’ll be a tasty one.” When asked about the long-term possibilities, Moores remained open. “There’s always potential. You try to build relationships with good players who can return and become part of the club. It’s not just about individual talent, but about creating strong team spirit — and Mo ticks all those boxes.” Earlier, Abbas signed for Nottinghamshire CCC for the 2020 season but due to the COVID pandemic was unable to play for them and following year with the COVID travel restrictions eased he was snapped by Hampshire CCC where he stayed for the following four seasons."

"Doves, deaths and rations: Papal elections over time","May 05, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603203-doves-deaths-and-rations-papal-elections-over-time,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-05/603203_2935982_updates.jpg,"Cardinals electing Pope Francis's successor will have an easier time than many of their predecessors, who endured spartan conditions and were even locked up for so long that some of them died. Here are some notable papal elections through the ages. In 236, the Christian community of Rome was debating potential papal candidates when a white dove landed on the head of a bystander, Fabian. ""At this, everyone, as if moved by a single divine inspiration, eagerly and wholeheartedly called out that Fabian was worthy,"" according to Eusebius, a Church historian of the era. The blessing was a mixed one for Fabian, who died 14 years later a martyr, persecuted by Emperor Decius. In the early Church, popes were elected by members of the clergy and the Roman nobility, and the votes were rife with meddling. One of the most infamous elections was in 532, following the death of Boniface II, which involved ""large-scale bribing of royal officials and influential senators"", according to PG Maxwell-Stuart in ""Chronicle of the Popes"". In the end, an ordinary priest was elected, Mercurius. He became the first pope to change his name, to John. In 1059, Nicholas II gave cardinals sole authority to choose pontiffs. The idea of locking up the cardinals to encourage a quick decision began in the 13th century, the word conclave comes from the Latin phrase meaning ""with key"". In 1241, when the election was dragging on, the head of Rome's government locked the cardinals into a dilapidated building and refused to clean the lavatories or provide doctors for those who fell ill. According to Frederic Baumgartner in his ""Behind Locked Doors: A History of the Papal Elections"", the cardinals only decided on one of them died and the Romans threatened to exhume his corpse and have it make decisions. After 70 days, they agreed on Goffredo Castiglioni, who became Celestine IV. The longest conclave in history lasted almost three years following the death of Clement IV in November 1268, held in the papal palace at Viterbo, near Rome. From late 1269 the cardinals allowed themselves to be locked in to try to reach a decision, and by June 1270, frustrated locals tore the roof off in a bid to speed things along. They were apparently inspired by a quip by an English cardinal that without the roof, the Holy Spirit could descend unhindered. Teobaldo Visconti became pope Gregory X in September 1271. In response to the chaos that led to his election, Gregory X changed the rules, requiring cardinals to meet within 10 days of the pope's death, and ordering that their food be reduced over time. If there was no decision in three days, meals were to be reduced to only one of the two traditional Italian main courses. After five days, they would be cut back to just bread, water and wine, according to John L Allen's book ""Conclave"". The cardinals were also barred from drawing on their incomes during a conclave. Conclaves have for centuries been held in the Apostolic Palace and since 1878 in its Sistine Chapel. Cardinals have in the past slept in the Apostolic Palace, with cubicles erected with camp beds, and one bathroom for every 10 electors, according to Allen's ""Conclave"". The windows were sealed shut but in 1978, when the conclave took place during a stifling August, there was a near revolt by cardinals who demanded they be opened. John Paul II — elected in a second conclave in that year, in October — ordered the construction of the $20 million Santa Marta guesthouse in the Vatican grounds, where Francis himself lived, and where the cardinals now stay. It has more than 100 guest suites and around two dozen single rooms. But during the conclave there, too, the windows are sealed shut. Technically any baptised male can become pope, but the last non-cardinal to be elected was the archbishop of Bari, Bartolomeo Prignano, who became Urban VI in 1378. Not everyone is keen. The first words of Albino Luciani, on becoming John Paul I in 1978, were ""May God forgive you for what you have done!"" He died 33 days later. In 1978, after appearing to the crowds in St Peter's Square, John Paul II reportedly walked around pouring champagne for the cardinals and singing Polish folk songs. In 2005, Benedict XVI invited all the cardinals to stay for dinner with champagne and there were also songs, the late cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor recalled afterwards. The longest conclave in more recent times was that of 1831, which elected Gregory XVI after more than 50 days. The longest of the 20th century lasted only five days (14 ballots) when Pius XI was elected in 1922. In 2005, Benedict XVI was elected in just two days (four ballots) and Francis in 2013 also in two days (five ballots)."
"After suspending treaty with Pakistan, India starts work on hydro projects","May 05, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603214-after-suspending-treaty-with-pakistan,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-05/603214_2604937_updates.jpg,"India has begun work to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters , after fresh tension with Pakistan led it to suspend a water-sharing pact. The work represents the first tangible step by India to operate outside agreements covered by the Indus Waters Treaty, unbroken since 1960 despite three wars and several other conflicts between the nuclear-armed rivals. Last month, however, New Delhi suspended the pact that ensures supply to 80% of Pakistani farms after an attack in IIOJK killed 26, and it identified two of the three assailants as Pakistani. Islamabad has threatened international legal action over the suspension and denied any role in the attack, warning, ""Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan ... will be considered as an act of war"". A ""reservoir flushing"" process to remove sediment began on Thursday, carried out by India's biggest hydropower company, state-run NHPC Ltd, and authorities in IIOJK, the three sources said. The work may not immediately threaten supply to Pakistan, which depends on rivers flowing through India for much of its irrigation and hydropower, but it could eventually be affected if other projects launch similar efforts. There are more than half a dozen such projects in the region. India did not inform Pakistan about the work at the Salal and Baglihar projects, which is being done for the first time since they were built in 1987 and 2008/09, respectively, as the treaty had blocked such work, the sources added. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to the media. India's NHPC and the neighbouring governments did not reply to emails from Reuters to seek comment. The flushing operation ran for three days from May 1, the sources said. ""This is the first time such an exercise has taken place and will help in more efficient power generation and prevent damage to turbines,"" one of the sources told Reuters . ""We were also asked to open the adjustable gates for cleaning, which we did from May 1,"" the source said, adding that the effort aimed to free dam operation from any restrictions. People living on the banks of the Chenab river in IIOJK said they noticed water had been released from both Salal and Baglihar dams from Thursday to Saturday. The flushing of hydropower projects requires nearly emptying a reservoir to force out sediments whose build-up is a major cause of decline in output. For example, two of the sources said, power delivered by the 690-MegaWatt Salal project was far below its capacity, because Pakistan had prevented such flushing, while silting also hit output at the 900-MW Baglihar project. ""Flushing is not a common thing because it leads to a lot of water wastage,"" said one of the sources. ""Downstream countries are expected to be informed in case it leads to any inundation."" Building both projects had required extensive back and forth with Pakistan, which worries about losing out on its share of water. Under the 1960 treaty, which split the Indus and its tributaries between the neighbours, India had also shared data such as hydrological flows at various spots on the rivers flowing through India and issued flood warnings. India's water minister has vowed to ""ensure no drop of the Indus river's water reaches Pakistan"". Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately, however, as the treaty has allowed it only to build hydropower plants without significant storage dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan. The suspension means India ""can now pursue our projects at free will"", said Kushvinder Vohra, a recently retired head of India's Central Water Commission who worked extensively on Indus disputes with Pakistan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has sought to renegotiate the treaty in recent years and the archfoes have tried to settle some of their differences at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague. These concerns related to the size of the water storage area at the region's Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants."

""The Ministry of Home Affairs has asked several states to conduct mock drills for effective civil defence"", Kanchan Gupta, a senior advisor from the information ministry, said in a statement. Gupta said this would involve rehearsing an ""evacuation plan"" and the ""training of civilians, students, etc, on the civil defence aspects to protect themselves in the event of a hostile attack"". Drills will also test air raid warning sirens, prepare for blackouts, and ready vital installations for camouflage. New Delhi blames Pakistan for an attack on civilians at the tourist site of Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir on April 22, sparking a series of heated threats and diplomatic tit-for-tat measures. Pakistan rejects the accusations and has repeatedly made clear it will respond with force to any aggression by India. Islamabad said on Monday it had conducted a second missile test, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 120 kilometres. Also on Monday, India's army claimed its troops had exchanged gunfire with Pakistani soldiers overnight across the Line of Control in multiple sites, which it says has taken place every night since April 24. Muslim-majority Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from British rule in 1947, with both governing part of the disputed territory separately and claiming it in its entirety."

The stipend and potential airfare for migrants who voluntarily depart would cost less than an actual deportation, the agency said. The average cost of arresting, detaining and deporting someone without legal status is currently about $17,000, according to DHS. President Donald Trump, a Republican, took office in January pledging to deport millions of people but so far has trailed deportations under his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. Biden's administration faced high levels of illegal immigration and quickly returned many caught crossing the border. The Trump administration has deported 152,000 people since January 20, according to DHS, lower than the 195,000 deported from February-April last year under Biden. Trump's administration has tried to encourage migrants to leave voluntarily by threatening steep fines, trying to strip away legal status, and deporting migrants to notorious prisons in Guantanamo Bay and El Salvador. ""If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. In March, the administration launched a rebranded app called CBP Home to facilitate self-deportation. The app, previously called CBP One , was used by the Biden administration to allow migrants to enter the US legally. Trump previewed the stipend plan in April, saying the US would consider allowing migrants to return. ""If they're good, if we want them back in, we're going to work with them to get them back in as quickly as we can,"" he said. In the announcement on Monday, DHS said people who choose to leave ""may help preserve"" the ability to return legally, but did not cite any specific pathway or programme."

Some cardinals are looking for a new pope who will continue with Francis’ push for a more transparent, welcoming Church, while others are seeking retrenchment to more traditional roots that put a premium on doctrine. Conclaves are often spread out over several days, with multiple votes held before a contender wins the necessary three-quarters majority to become pope. The world’s Catholic cardinals have been meeting on a near-daily basis since the day after Francis' death on April 21 to discuss the state of the 1.4-billion-member Church, with the number of participating clerics gradually swelling. The Vatican said 180 cardinals, including 132 electors, took part in a meeting on Monday morning. The 133rd elector is also in Rome, but did not take part in the discussions. Two cardinals, one from Spain and one from Kenya, will not be joining the conclave for health reasons, the Vatican said. Among the questions addressed on Monday were ""strong concerns"" about divisions within the Church, said the Vatican spokesman — a possible reference to splits over Francis’ decision to allow blessings for same-sex partners and to open discussion about the role of women in the Church. Cardinals also talked about the profile of a future pope — ""a figure who must be present, close, capable of being a bridge and a guide ... a shepherd close to the real life of the people,"" the spokesman said. While there are a few cardinals seen as potential front-runners to succeed Francis — two often mentioned are Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle — many of the voting clerics have not made up their minds. ""My list is changing, and I think it will continue to change over the next few days,"" British Cardinal Vincent Nichols, participating in his first conclave, told Reuters . ""It's a process which for me is far from concluded, far from concluded."" The cardinals will hold a second session of talks on Monday afternoon, with a final round expected on Tuesday. Two Vatican guest houses will house the cardinals during the conclave, when they will be barred from contact with the outside world. German Cardinal Walter Kasper, who is 92 and cannot take part in the vote, said he was sure the electors would choose someone to pursue Francis' progressive agenda. ""I believe that there is a very clear expectation. People want a pope to follow Francis. A pastor who knows the language of the heart, who does not close himself in palaces,"" Kasper told La Stampa newspaper."
Widow of Indian Navy officer killed in Pahalgam faces online abuse,"May 05, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603290-widow-of-indian-navy-officer-faces-online-abuse-after-calling-for-peace-following-pahalgam-attack,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-05/603290_2535559_updates.jpg,"Himanshi Narwal, widow of Indian Navy officer Lieutenant Vinay Narwal who was killed in the Pahalgam attack on April 22, has been facing abuse on social media for urging people not to be hostile towards Muslims or Kashmiris. According to NDTV , the couple, who were married days before the Pahalgam attack, were visiting Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) for their honeymoon when the deadly attack left 26 people, including the Navy officer, dead. Heartbreaking visuals of Narwal sitting beside the body of her husband also went viral on social media. The terror attack triggered angry responses on social media, with a section of people targeting Kashmiris and Muslims. However, the navy officer’s widow appealed to the nation not to be hostile towards Muslims or Kashmiris. ""I want the entire country to pray for him (Vinay), that wherever he is, he has found peace. That is all I ask,"" she said. ""There is something else I wish to say. I see hatred is growing, directed at Muslims and Kashmiris. We do not want this. We only wish for peace, nothing else,"" Narwal said. She also demanded that those behind the attack be brought to justice. But the appeal for peace drew a wave of abuse directed at the young woman. While some made vile remarks about her personal life, others said she must not get her husband's pension. Amid the trolling, many people supported her and urged authorities to take note. Condemning the trolling, India’s National Commission for Women (NCW) said: “The whole country is hurt and enraged by this attack. After Lieutenant Vinay Narwal's death, the way his wife, Himanshi Narwal, is being targeted on social media for a remark is extremely condemnable and unfortunate. Targeting a woman for her opinions or trolling her about her personal life is not acceptable at all."""
US court blocks Trump attempt to strip migrants' legal status,"May 06, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603301-us-court-blocks-trump-attempt-to-strip-migrants-legal-status,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-06/603301_6537568_updates.jpg,"A US federal appeals court has rejected an effort by former President Donald Trump’s administration to revoke the temporary legal status of approximately 400,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, Reuters reported. On Monday, the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals declined a request to lift a lower court ruling that halted the Department of Homeland Security’s plan to end a two-year parole granted to these migrants. That parole had originally been authorised during President Joe Biden’s tenure. The ruling preserves protections for thousands of individuals who were granted temporary legal residence on humanitarian grounds. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The administration's action marked an expansion of the Republican president's hardline crackdown on immigration and push to ramp up deportations, including of noncitizens previously granted a legal right to live and work in the United States. The ruling came in a lawsuit by immigrant rights advocates challenging an agency decision to pause various Biden-era parole programs that have allowed Ukrainian, Afghan, Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan migrants to enter the country. While the case was pending, the Homeland Security Department on March 25 announced in a Federal Register notice that it had decided to terminate the two-year parole granted to about 400,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelan migrants. US District Judge Indira Talwani, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, on April 25 halted the agency's action, which she said revoked previously granted parole and work authorisations for migrants on a categorical basis and without a necessary case-by-case review."
Pentagon slashes top military brass by 20% under Trump directive,"May 06, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603307-pentagon-slashes-top-military-brass-by-20-under-trump-directive,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-06/603307_8523349_updates.jpg,"WASHINGTON: Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth ordered at least a 20 percent reduction in the number of active-duty four-star generals and admirals in the US military, a memo from the defence secretary said. The move is the latest major shake-up at the Pentagon under President Donald Trump’s administration, which has already dismissed a number of senior officers this year. The memo also calls for an additional 10 percent reduction in the number of general and flag officers, and a 20 percent cut in the number of general officers in the National Guard. It did not specify how the reductions would be accomplished. There were 38 four-star officers — the highest rank that can usually be achieved in the US military — and a total of 817 generals and admirals in the active-duty forces as of March 2025. The cuts are aimed at removing “redundant force structure to optimise and streamline leadership by reducing excess general and flag officer positions,” the memo said. “Through these measures, we will uphold our position as the most lethal fighting force in the world, achieving peace through strength and ensuring greater efficiency, innovation, and preparedness for any challenge that lies ahead,” it added. Since beginning his second term in January, Trump has overseen a purge of top officers, including chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles “CQ” Brown, whom he dismissed without explanation in February. Other senior officers removed this year include the heads of the Navy and Coast Guard, the general who headed the National Security Agency, the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, a Navy admiral assigned to NATO, and three top military lawyers. Hegseth has insisted the president is simply choosing the leaders he wants, but Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the potential politicisation of the traditionally neutral US military."
"Trump dismisses outrage over AI Pope image, calls it a joke","May 06, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603313-trump-dismisses-outrage-over-ai-pope-image-calls-it-a-joke,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-06/603313_5446503_updates.jpg,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Monday dismissed the backlash against an AI-generated image of him as the pope posted by the White House on social media, saying it was a harmless joke, but communications experts said they did not see the funny side. The weekend AI-generated posts of Trump dressed in white papal vestments and another of him wielding one of the red light sabres preferred by villains in the Star Wars films appeared typical of the provocation the president employs to energise supporters and troll critics. Since returning to office on January 20, Trump has dominated news cycles. In an otherwise relatively quiet weekend, the two images ensured Trump stayed a major topic of conversation on social media and beyond. Throughout his political career, Trump has embraced bold visuals, from posing in a rubbish truck to standing outside a church during protests against police brutality. But the experts told Reuters that unlike those rooted in reality, AI images blur fact and fiction in ways that can mislead. “I think we are seeing a new phenomenon – the merging of social media and AI power, organised for political power and narrative dominance,” said John Wihbey, director of the AI-Media Strategies Lab at Northeastern University in Boston. “He’s exploiting this uncharted territory,” Wihbey said. “I suspect politicians around the world will begin to use generative AI and social together in newfound ways.” Trump told reporters on Monday that the pope image was posted as a joke on his Truth Social account, which was then reposted by the White House across social media. “I had nothing to do with it,” Trump said. “It was just, somebody did it in fun. It’s fine. Have to have a little fun don’t you?” The White House did not respond to questions about who other than Trump posts to his Truth Social account and who created the two memes. For many Catholics in the US, Italy and elsewhere, the image of Trump dressed as God's representative on Earth was offensive. Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi wrote on X: “This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the global right enjoys being a clown.” Democratic strategist Michael Ceraso viewed the White House's posting of the AI images as a deliberate attempt to generate buzz. ""He's the first influencer president,"" Ceraso said of Trump, urging Democrats not to get caught up in whipped-up controversies. Trump, he said, takes his cues from professional wrestling: “You can be the bad guy or the good guy as long as you are getting crowd reaction.” Since becoming president, Trump has posted AI-generated images of a beachfront resort in war-ravaged Gaza and of himself as a king and as an Al Capone-type gangster. Jennifer Mercieca, a presidential rhetoric scholar at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, argued Trump was seeking to project images of strength at a time when his presidential approval rating is dropping. “Trump's policies are unpopular, and his presidency is unpopular,"" Mercieca said. “Within this context, Trump has created a visual fantasy of himself as a hero, attempting to persuade the nation (and the world) that he is, in fact, a hero.” The most recent Reuters/Ipsos polling had Trump's approval rating at 42% with 53% of respondents disapproving of him and showed concerns mounting among Americans over his economic and immigration policies. He peaked at 47% in the first days of his presidency. Northeastern University’s Wihbey said a greater test of AI’s ability to warp political reality will come if Trump attempts to insert himself into more “photo-realistic” images that suggest historical events and scenes that did not occur."
Trump administration freezes billions of dollars in future grants to Harvard,"May 06, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603325-trump-administration-freezes-billions-of-dollars-in-future-grants-to-harvard,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-06/603325_1780442_updates.jpg,"The United States Department of Education informed Harvard University on Monday that it was freezing billions of dollars in future research grants and other aid until the nation's oldest and wealthiest college concedes to several demands from the Trump administration, a senior department official said. The move represents the latest salvo from a Trump administration willing to use the power of the federal purse to force institutions, from law firms to universities, to make sweeping policy changes or lose billions of dollars in federal grants and contracts. In a letter to Harvard, US Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon said the university must address concerns about antisemitism on campus, school policies that consider a student’s race, and administration complaints that it has abandoned its pursuit of “academic excellence” while employing relatively few conservative faculty members. ""This letter is to inform you that Harvard should no longer seek GRANTS from the federal government since none will be provided,"" McMahon wrote. Harvard said the McMahon letter doubles down on demands that would impose ""unprecedented and improper control"" over the university and makes new threats to ""illegally"" withhold funding for lifesaving research. ""Harvard will also continue to defend against illegal government overreach aimed at stifling research and innovation that make Americans safer and more secure,"" a university spokesperson said. The freeze of future funding represents a slightly altered tactic by the Trump administration, whose attempts to freeze top schools of existing funds raised legal eyebrows. Trump has targeted Harvard over allegations of antisemitism on campus during pro-Palestinian protests, which the US president has termed ""antisemitic"", amid ongoing war in the Middle East. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, say the government wrongly conflate their criticism of regional conflict with antisemitism and their advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism. In recent weeks, the administration began a formal review into nearly $9 billion in federal funding for Harvard, demanded the university ban diversity, equity and inclusion practices, and crack down on protestors. Harvard rejected numerous Trump demands last month, calling them an attack on free speech and academic freedom. It sued the Trump administration after it suspended about $2.3 billion in federal funding for the educational institution, while also pledging to tackle discrimination on campus. In its lawsuit against the Trump administration, Harvard said the government's funding cuts will have stark ""real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, (and) researchers"" while putting in jeopardy crucial medical and scientific research. Harvard has a $53 billion endowment, the largest of any US university, but the funds are often restricted and used for things like financial aid and scholarships."
UN warns of 'unsettling' development slowdown in 2024,"May 06, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603339-un-warns-of-unsettling-development-slowdown-in-2024,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-06/603339_2268721_updates.jpg,"UNITED NATIONS: Humanity recorded an unexpected and ""unsettling"" slowdown in development in 2024 as the global post-pandemic recovery began losing steam, well before President Donald Trump dramatically cut US international aid, the UN warned on Tuesday. The world had rebounded from the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic by 2023, as measured by the UN’s Human Development Index (HDI), which charts living standards, health and education. But that rebound appears to be losing momentum, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)’s annual report, released on Tuesday. If that ""unsettling"" slowdown becomes the new normal, achieving levels of human development once hoped for by 2030 ""could slip by decades — making our world less secure, more divided, and more vulnerable to economic and ecological shocks,"" warned UNDP head Achim Steiner. Recent drastic cuts to international aid announced by several countries — most notably the United States, where Trump has slashed programmes and dismantled USAID, the country’s main foreign development arm — will exacerbate the issue, Steiner told AFP in an interview. If wealthy countries stop funding development, ""this will ultimately impact economies, societies, and yes, I think it will also register maybe a year or two down the line in the Human Development Index, lower life expectancy, declining incomes, [and] more conflicts,"" Steiner said. UNDP experts are not yet certain of the underlying causes of the slowdown observed in 2024. But they have identified one of the driving forces as a slackening of progress in life expectancy, perhaps linked to the side-effects of Covid, or to the wars that are multiplying around the world. There is a potential glimmer of hope: artificial intelligence could create the conditions for kickstarting development, the UNDP suggested. AI ""is perhaps the greatest potential pivot in putting development of individual economies, but also of maybe poor people, wealthy people, on a different trajectory. It will change virtually every aspect of our lives,"" Steiner said. The report stressed that it would come down to how people use the technology, however. There are risks. Access to AI in poorer countries is not the same as in wealthier ones, and cultural biases could influence the way the tools are developed, it said. But ""we can design for reducing that risk,"" said Steiner, adding that it should not be an impediment to using AI for medical research, for example. ""The future is in our hands,"" the UNDP report said. ""Technology is about people, not just things. Beneath the razzle-dazzle of invention lurk important choices, by the few or the many, whose consequences will reverberate across generations."""
US appeals court rejects Trump bid to revoke thousands of migrants' status,"May 06, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603341-us-appeals-court-rejects-trump-bid-to-revoke-thousands-of-migrants-status,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-06/603341_2121123_updates.jpg,"BOSTON: A federal appeals court rejected on Monday a request by US President Donald Trump's administration to allow it to revoke the temporary legal status of hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans living in the United States. The Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put on hold a judge's order halting the Department of Homeland Security's move to cut short a two-year ""parole"" granted to the migrants under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. The administration's action marked an expansion of the Republican president's hardline crackdown on immigration and push to ramp up deportations, including of noncitizens previously granted a legal right to live and work in the United States. The administration argued Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had discretion to categorically end the migrants' status and that the judge's order was forcing the US government to ""retain hundreds of thousands of aliens in the country against its will."" But a three-judge panel comprised entirely of appointees of Democratic presidents said Noem ""has not at this point made a 'strong showing' that her categorical termination of plaintiffs' parole is likely to be sustained on appeal."" Karen Tumlin, a lawyer whose immigrant rights group Justice Action Centre pursued the case, welcomed the court's decision. She called the administration's actions ""reckless and illegal."" The administration could now ask the US Supreme Court to intervene. ""The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law to our immigration system,"" Homeland Security Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that."" A lawsuit by immigrant rights advocates representing migrants challenged the agency decision to pause various Biden-era programs that have allowed Ukrainian, Afghan, Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan migrants to enter the country. While the case was pending, the Homeland Security Department on March 25 announced in a Federal Register notice that it had decided to terminate the two-year parole granted to about 400,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelan migrants. US District Judge Indira Talwani, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, on April 25 halted the agency's action, which she said revoked previously granted parole and work authorisations for migrants on a categorical basis and without a necessary case-by-case review. She said the department's sole basis for declining to allow the migrants' parole status to naturally expire was based on a legal error, as it wrongly concluded doing so would foreclose the department's ability to legally expedite their deportations."
India advances IIOJK hydro projects after suspending pact with Pakistan,"May 06, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603368-india-advances-iiojk-hydro-projects-after-suspending-pact-with-pakistan,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-06/603368_7939185_updates.jpg,"India has advanced the start date of four under-construction hydropower projects in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) region by months after suspending a water-sharing treaty with Pakistan that had slowed progress, according to an industry source and a government document. The updated schedule for the projects, whose construction Pakistan generally opposes because it fears it would lead to less water downstream, is another sign of how India is trying to take advantage of its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 following a deadly attack in Kashmir last month. India has claimed two of the ""terrorists"" who killed 26 men at a popular tourist site in Kashmir on April 22 came from Pakistan, and has taken a series of diplomatic and economic steps against Islamabad as ties between the nuclear-armed neighbours nosedive. Islamabad has denied any role in the attack, threatened legal action over the suspension, and said any ""attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan ... will be considered as an act of war"". Pakistan depends on the Indus system for 80% of its farms and most of its hydroelectric output. The armies have exchanged small arms fire across the border every night for nearly two weeks, and Pakistan says India is on the verge of a military assault. New Delhi has so far ignored Pakistan's concerns and made moves that have already throttled water supplies to the country, including by running maintenance work to raise the holding capacity of two operational hydroelectric plants in the IIOJK. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has asked authorities to clear hurdles to the speedy construction of four hydro projects with a combined capacity of 3,014 megawatts, according to the document, an undated list made by the power ministry and reviewed by Reuters. The four projects are: Pakal Dul (1,000 MW), Kiru (624 MW), Kwar (540 MW) and Ratle (850 MW). All of them are on the Chenab River, whose waters are mainly meant for Pakistan, but India is allowed to build run-of-water hydro projects without any significant storage. State-run NHPC, India's biggest hydropower company, is building all the projects. They are due to start between June 2026 and August 2028, the document shows. Various agencies, including those looking at law enforcement and labour supply, have been asked to help speed up the work, according to the document. NHPC and the Indian ministries of power, water resources and foreign affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Pakistan's Indus River System Authority said its officials held a meeting on Monday and ""noted with concern unanimously that a sudden decrease in River Chenab inflows at Marala (the headworks that regulates flow) due to short supply by India would result in more shortages"" for summer crops. Downstream reservoirs would be used pragmatically ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in the Chenab River"", the authority said in a statement late on Monday. India's water minister vowed last month to ""ensure no drop of the Indus River's water reaches Pakistan"". The Indian industry source said there had been several meetings of officials from various private and government agencies with the power ministry in the past week about projects in occupied Kashmir. ""Generally, instructions to fast-track existing projects like this mean that the government wants to plan new ones,"" said the source, who declined to be identified since the issue was sensitive. In total, India wants work expedited on a total of seven projects with a combined capacity of 7 gigawatts, costing about Rs400 billion. Reuters could not identify all the projects. Pakistan and India are already in dispute over Ratle in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague. The dispute is about the pondage, or small water storage area, the turbine design and some other specifications. The water treaty had required New Delhi to share with Islamabad extensive details on projects on the three Indus rivers meant for Pakistan — the Indus itself, the Chenab and the Jhelum. Modi's government has been seeking a modification of the treaty citing India's population growth and the need for more cleaner forms of energy like hydropower. While government officials and experts on both sides had said India would not be able to stop water flows immediately, as the treaty allowed it only to build plants which do not require significant storage dams, a Pakistan official said flows from the Chenab river had already fallen drastically. Since Sunday, the water flow has fallen by 90% from usual levels, Muhammad Khalid Idrees Rana, a spokesperson for Pakistan's Indus River System Authority, told Bloomberg News. A source at Pakistan's Indus authority said there have been major swings in Chenab flow since Sunday, when water at the Marala headworks was 31,000 cusecs, then fell to 3,100 cusecs on Monday, and was now back up to 25,000. ""The variations in the water supply are because of India's work at (some hydro projects),"" said the source. ""They can do these variations where they stop water and then dump. The magnitude of these variations can't cause major damage ... but they do impact the canals."""
Germany's Merz elected chancellor after surprise setback,"May 06, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603389-germanys-merz-elected-chancellor-after-surprise-setback,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-06/603389_921820_updates.jpg,"Germany's conservative leader Friedrich Merz won on Tuesday a nail-biter second vote in parliament to become chancellor after he lost the first round in a stunning early setback. Merz, 69, scored an absolute majority of 325 against 289 in the secret vote in the lower house of parliament. He takes over at the helm of a coalition between his CDU/CSU alliance and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) of the outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier was set to appoint him as post-war Germany's 10th chancellor later Tuesday, along with his cabinet, before Merz is due to visit Paris and then Warsaw on Wednesday. His victory caps a long ambition to lead Europe's biggest economy, which was first foiled decades ago by party rival Angela Merkel who went on to serve as chancellor for 16 years. Merz's eventual victory on Tuesday was bittersweet as the initial defeat — the first such outcome in Germany's post-war history — pointed to rumblings of discontent within his uneasy coalition. The unprecedented first-round loss was ""a bad start"" for Merz and ""shows that he cannot fully rely on his two coalition parties, wrote analyst Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank. ""That will sow some doubts about his ability to fully pursue his agenda, damaging his domestic and international authority at least initially."" The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) especially cheered the heavy political blow to Merz, who has vowed to restore stability in Berlin after half a year of political turmoil. ""Merz should step aside and the way should be cleared for a general election,"" AfD co-leader Alice Weidel said earlier, calling the first-round result a ""good day for Germany"". The first secret vote was expected to be a formality but turned to disaster for Merz when he failed to muster the required absolute majority, falling short by six votes. The early setback for Merz stunned Germany and set off frantic crisis meetings in the Bundestag. Merz has vowed to revive the ailing economy and strengthen Berlin's role in Europe as it responds to rapid change since US President Donald Trump returned to power. Trump has heaped pressure on European allies, complaining they spend too little on NATO and imposing tariffs that are especially painful to export power Germany. CDU parliamentary leader Jens Spahn had emphasised the urgency of a new government taking office, given the economic and geopolitical turbulence. ""The whole of Europe, perhaps even the whole world, is watching this second round of voting,"" Spahn said before the second vote, urging MPs to ""be aware of this special responsibility"". Merz, who boasts a strong business background but has never held a government leadership post, said on Monday: ""We live in times of profound change, of profound upheaval... and of great uncertainty. ""And that is why we know that it is our historic obligation to lead this coalition to success,"" he said. To take over as chancellor, Merz needed an absolute majority of 316 votes. But in Tuesday's first vote, he only won the backing of 310 MPs, with 307 voting against him. Capital Economics analyst Franziska Palmas argued Merz's initial setback ""does leave Merz severely weakened and suggests that hopes for more stability in German politics may be disappointed""."
Cardinals enter seclusion ahead of secret conclave to elect new pope,"May 06, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603391-cardinals-enter-seclusion-ahead-of-secret-conclave-to-elect-new-pope,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-06/603391_175966_updates.jpg,"VATICAN CITY: Cardinals who will take part in the secret conclave to elect a new Catholic pope began checking into two Vatican hotels on Tuesday, where they will be barred from contact with the outside world as they decide who should succeed Pope Francis. The conclave will start behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday afternoon, with all cardinals under the age of 80 able to vote on who should be the next leader of the 1.4-billion-member Church. The race to succeed Francis, who died last month, is seen as wide open. Although a few names have been cited as possible front-runners, several of the 133 cardinals expected to vote in the conclave have said they do not know who will become the next pope. ""I have no guess,"" Cardinal Robert McElroy said during a visit to a parish in Rome on Monday evening. The conclave process is ""profound and mysterious,"" said McElroy, the archbishop of Washington, D.C. ""I can give you no insights into who is ahead,"" he said. Some cardinals are looking for a new pope who will continue with Francis' push for a more transparent, welcoming Church, while others are seeking retrenchment to more traditional roots that put a premium on doctrine. Conclaves are often spread out over several days, with multiple votes held before a contender wins the necessary three-quarters majority to become pope. During the conclave period, the voting cardinals will stay in two Vatican guesthouses and take an oath to remain out of contact with anyone not participating in the secret vote. Francis had a priority of appointing cardinals from countries that had never had them before, such as Haiti, South Sudan and Myanmar. This conclave will be the most geographically diverse in the Church's 2,000-year history, with clerics from 70 countries taking part. Japanese Cardinal Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi told La Repubblica newspaper that many of the 23 cardinals from Asia voting in the conclave planned to vote as a block. He contrasted their strategy with that of the 53 cardinals from Europe, who are known to vote in terms of individual countries or other personal preferences. ""We Asians are probably more unanimous in supporting one or two candidates ... we will see which name will come out as the leading candidate,"" said Kikuchi. The cardinals, who had been meeting at the Vatican ahead of the conclave nearly every day since April 22 to discuss matters facing the global Church, held the last of those pre-conclave assemblies on Tuesday. In a statement released after the meeting, the clerics lamented ongoing conflicts ""in Ukraine, the Middle East, and many other parts of the world."" ""We make a heartfelt appeal to all parties involved to reach a permanent ceasefire as soon as possible and to negotiate, without preconditions and further delays, the long-desired peace by the populations involved,"" they said. Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said the cardinals also discussed on Tuesday what kind of characteristics they hope to see in the next pope. Some cardinals said the new pontiff should continue Francis' focus on social justice issues, such as addressing global climate change, and spoke of ""having a pope of mercy and hope,"" said Bruni."
PSL 10: Peshawar Zalmi keep playoff hopes alive with victory over Multan Sultans,"May 05, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603255-psl-10-multan-sultans-win-toss-opt-to-bat-first-against-peshawar-zalmi,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-05/603255_2276151_updates.jpg,"MULTAN: Peshawar Zalmi kept their playoff hopes alive in the 10th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) with a dominant performance, defeating Multan Sultans by seven wickets in a must-win encounter. Chasing a modest 109-run target, Zalmi knocked the winning runs for the loss of just three wickets and 42 balls to spare to register their fourth victory, which helped them close in on fourth-placed Lahore Qalandars. The 2017 champions, however, had a contrasting start to the pursuit as Mitchell Owen (one) fell victim to David Willey in the first over with just eight runs on the board. Ayub then put together a one-sided 49-run partnership for the second wicket with skipper Babar Azam, who scored a scratchy 13-ball eight before being cleaned up by emerging pacer Shahid Aziz in the seventh over. Aziz struck again in his next over to dismiss set batter Ayub, who remained the top-scorer for Zalmi with a 33-ball 49, studded with four fours and three sixes. Bryant, on the other hand, batted until the end and steered Zalmi to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 38 off 20 deliveries, laced with five fours and a six. He also shared a match-winning 40-run partnership with Mohammad Haris, who scored seven not out from 10 deliveries. Shahid Aziz led the Sultans’ bowling charge with two wickets for just 17 runs in his three overs, while Willey bagged one. Earlier, Peshawar Zalmi delivered a disciplined bowling performance to restrict Multan Sultans to a modest 108 runs. Captain Mohammad Rizwan’s decision to bat first backfired as his side was bowled out for just 108 in 19.1 overs. The home side got off to a shaky start with both openers — Yasir Khan (10) and skipper Rizwan (17) — falling inside the powerplay, leaving the score at 34/2. Following the early setbacks, Tayyab Tahir attempted to counterattack with a brisk cameo but managed only 22 off 18 deliveries, including two fours and a six, before falling to Ahmed Daniyal in the ninth over. His dismissal triggered a collapse, as Sultans lost three quick wickets and slipped to 66/6 in 12.1 overs. Meanwhile, Shai Hope tried to anchor the innings during the collapse and stitched a cautious 20-run partnership with David Willey. He eventually top-scored with 23 off 21 balls (2 fours, 1 six) before being caught and bowled by Alzarri Joseph in the 15th over. Sultans’ struggles continued as David Willey was dismissed in the 17th over by Ahmed Daniyal after a slow knock of 8 off 16 balls, which included one boundary. Mohammad Hasnain offered brief resistance at the end with 11 off 10 balls but was the last man to fall on the first delivery of the final over. Ahmed Daniyal was the pick of the bowlers for Zalmi, finishing with figures of 3/17 in four overs. Maaz Sadaqat and Luke Wood claimed two wickets each, while Ali Raza, Saim Ayub, and Alzarri Joseph took one apiece. Earlier, Multan Sultans won the toss and elected to bat first against Peshawar Zalmi. Squads Multan Sultans: Mohammad Rizwan, Usama Mir and Michael Bracewell (all platinum), David Willey, Iftikhar Ahmed and Usman Khan (all diamond), Chris Jordan, Kamran Ghulam and Mohammad Hasnain (all gold), Faisal Akram, Akif Javed, Gudakesh Motie, Josh Little and Tayyab Tahir (all silver), Shahid Aziz and Ubaid Shah (both emerging), Muhammad Amir Barki, Ashton Turner and Yasir Khan (all supplementary).

Zhao becomes China's first world snooker champion after comeback from ban,"May 06, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603334-zhao-becomes-chinas-first-world-snooker-champion-after-comeback-from-ban,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-06/603334_1852487_updates.jpg,"Zhao Xintong became the first Chinese player to win the World Snooker Championship with a victory over Welshman and three-times winner Mark Williams at the Crucible Theatre on Monday, the latest chapter in Zhao's remarkable rise and fall story. The 28-year-old won by 18 frames to 12 to become the first amateur to win the world title, despite a spirited comeback attempt from Williams. ""I can't believe what I've done. It's very exciting,"" said Zhao, draped in a Chinese flag. ""I was so nervous tonight. Mark is still a top player and put me under so much pressure. He's the best. ""It's a very special moment for me, for Chinese snooker, for everyone."" Zhao received a 20-month ban in January 2023 after a match-fixing scandal that rocked the sport, the repercussions of which meant he was classed as an amateur at this event and needed to get through four rounds of qualifying to reach the Crucible — a gruelling run to the title that began on April 7. The Chinese player, who lives just a 10-minute walk from the Crucible venue, took an 11-6 overnight lead into Monday's third session. While Zhao looked completely unflappable and kept smiling throughout the afternoon session, Williams struggled for accuracy and appeared powerless to stop his opponent from taking a seemingly unassailable 17-8 lead, meaning Zhao needed to win just one frame in the evening final to claim the world title. But a free-wheeling Williams made things interesting by winning the evening's first four frames with a flurry of excellent shots before the younger player answered in the fifth to secure victory. The final was already historic no matter the result, as the 50-year-old Williams became the oldest player to reach the final with his semi-final win over world number one Judd Trump. ""It's been a brilliant tournament for me,"" said Williams, momentarily fighting back tears. ""The support I've had for the past two weeks has been unbelievable. ""But what a potter Zhao is. I'm glad I'll be too old when he's dominating the game. I've got nothing but admiration for what he's done, coming through the qualifiers. He hasn't played for two years, bashed everybody up. There's a new superstar of the game."" Zhao had swept aside seven-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan in the semi-finals to set up what was billed as the coronation of a new snooker king. The Chinese player, nicknamed ""the Cyclone"", raced out to an early 7-1 advantage in the best-of-35-frame contest but Williams staged a mini-revival in Sunday's second session to keep alive his hopes of a fourth title. No player, however, had overcome such a large overnight deficit since the tournament moved to the Crucible in 1977. Zhao joined Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy as the only qualifiers to capture snooker's most prestigious trophy. He banked a cheque for 500,000 pounds ($664,000.00) with Monday's victory, while Williams won 200,000 ($265,000) and climbed to number three in the world ranking. Williams has been struggling with vision problems and playing without glasses or contact lenses while he awaits lens replacement surgery in June. ""I'm still playing quite good stuff, even though my eyesight is a bit blurry,"" said Williams."

The cricket board made this announcement amid escalation of tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi following Indian forces attack inside Pakistan and the latter's retaliation. Pakistan armed forces shot down five Indian Air Force (IAF) jets, a combat drone, and destroyed brigade headquarters after India carried out missile strikes in cities of Punjab and Azad Kashmir. The United-Gladiators match toss will take place at 7:30pm, with the first ball to be bowled at 8pm. Additionally, there are no changes to the remaining fixtures of the PSL X, with Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium set to host the final of the marquee event on May 18. Tonight's match sees the return of PSL to Rawalpindi for four matches on May 7, 8, 9 and 10. Thereafter the final group stage match is scheduled in Multan on May 11.

Set a mammoth 264-run target, the defending champions crumbled under pressure and were bundled out for 154 in 19.3 overs, succumbing to their fourth consecutive defeat after an impressive five-match winning streak to start the tournament. Islamabad’s chase got off to a disastrous start as Mohammad Amir struck twice in the opening over, removing both openers — Kyle Mayers for a duck and Sahibzada Farhan for just one — leaving the side reeling at 1/2. Wicketkeeper-batter Muhammad Shahzad tried to rebuild with brief stands alongside acting captain Salman Ali Agha (6) and Mohammad Nawaz, but Wasim Jr removed Shahzad in the fourth over after a brisk 24 off 13 balls, which included three boundaries and a six. Mohammad Nawaz departed soon after, scoring 10 off four balls before falling to Khurram Shahzad, triggering a rapid collapse that saw United slump to 68/8 inside nine overs. Imad Wasim and Ben Dwarshuis added a glimmer of resistance with a 55-run stand for the ninth wicket. Dwarshuis chipped in with 31 off 24 balls, hitting one four and two sixes, while Imad top-scored with a fighting 56 off 41 balls, striking five boundaries and two maximums before falling to Wasim Jr in the final over. Amir was the standout bowler for the Gladiators, taking three wickets for just six runs in his two overs. He was supported by Wasim Jr and Abrar Ahmed, who bagged two each, while Faheem Ashraf, Khurram Shahzad and skipper Saud Shakeel chipped in with one scalp apiece. Earlier, Rilee Rossouw and Hasan Nawaz scored swashbuckling centuries and powered Quetta Gladiators to the highest-ever total in the PSL. United’s stand-in captain, Salman Ali Agha’s decision to bowl first backfired as Gladiators accumulated 263/3 in their allotted 20 overs, courtesy of a marathon 134-run partnership between centurions Rossouw and Nawaz. The leaders, however, got off to a shaky start to their innings as their opening pair of Saud Shakeel and Finn Allen (five) put together 24 runs until the latter got run out in the third over. Shakeel then shared a brisk 36-run partnership with Rossouw until falling victim to Naseem Shah in the last over of the batting powerplay. The skipper made 23 off 18 deliveries with the help of three boundaries. Following his dismissal, Rossouw joined forces with Hasan, and together they steered Gladiators into a commanding position by adding 134 runs for the second wicket. Rossouw, who was the core aggressor of the crucial stand, was eventually dismissed by Imad Wasim in the 16th over when the Gladiators were nearing the 200-run mark. The South African batter top-scored for the Gladiators with a 46-ball 104, studded with 20 boundaries, including six sixes. Nawaz, on the other hand, batted until the end and made a significant contribution with an unbeaten 100 off 45 deliveries, comprising nine fours and four sixes. The middle-order batter was involved in another crucial partnership for the Gladiators when he added 69 runs for the fourth wicket with Mark Chapman, who made 13 not out from eight deliveries. For United, Imad Wasim and Naseem Shah could pick up a wicket apiece. Squads Islamabad United: Shadab Khan and Naseem Shah (all platinum), Azam Khan, Imad Wasim and Jason Holder (all diamond), Haider Ali, Salman Ali Agha and Ben Dwarshuis (all gold), Colin Munro, Rumman Raees, Andries Gous, Mohammad Nawaz and Salman Irshad (all silver), Hunain Shah and Saad Masood (both emerging), Kyle Mayers, Mohammad Faiq, Sahibzada Farhan, Muhammad Shahzad and Riley Meredith (all supplementary).

Pakistan’s army “neutralised” 28 Indian drones, including one near the city’s stadium on Thursday morning, the foreign minister Ishaq Dar said. He called it “a deliberate attempt to target domestic and foreign cricket players”. “Pakistan Cricket Board confirms that the remaining matches of the Pakistan Super League have been shifted to the UAE,” read a PCB statement, which added that the schedule would be updated in due course. The decision was reached after several meetings between the franchise and the PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the interior minister. Naqvi said the decision was made for the sake of players’ safety. “The PCB has always stood by the position that politics and sports need to be kept apart. However, in view of the extremely irresponsible and dangerous Indian act of targeting the stadium, the PCB has taken this decision,” Naqvi was quoted as saying in the statement. “We have shifted the remaining matches to the UAE so that the domestic as well as foreign cricketers, who are our precious guests, can be saved from the possible reckless targeting by India.” Former champions Karachi Kings and Peshawar Zalmi were due to play at Rawalpindi stadium on Thursday but the match was postponed after a drone fell close to the stadium. Thirty-seven foreign players, including from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, are taking part in the PSL. India sent air strikes into Pakistan on Wednesday, two weeks after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for backing an attack on the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOK) — a claim Pakistan denied. Pakistan responded with heavy artillery fire and both sides accused each other on Thursday of carrying out waves of drone attacks. International cricket resumed in Pakistan in 2020 after being suspended following the 2009 terrorist attacks on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore. Several Australian and New Zealand players involved in this season’s PSL, including Australia’s David Warner, had travelled to Pakistan with their national teams in the recent past. The following fixtures will be rescheduled accordingly, said the PCB. • Karachi Kings v Peshawar Zalmi • Peshawar Zalmi v Lahore Qalandars • Islamabad United v Karachi Kings • Multan Sultans v Quetta Gladiators • Qualifier • Eliminator 1 • Eliminator 2 • Final"
India suspends money-spinning IPL 2025,"May 09, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603752-india-suspends-money-spinning-ipl-2025,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-09/603752_8010237_updates.jpg,"India's cricket board has suspended the money-spinning Indian Premier League (IPL) T20 tournament amid rising tensions between Pakistan and India. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) put off the 2025 IPL “with immediate effect for one week” in the wake of ongoing situation with Pakistan, according to a statement by BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia on Friday. The decision was made following consultations involving the IPL Governing Council, franchise representatives, broadcasters, sponsors, and security advisors. “The Board considered it prudent to act in the collective interest of all stakeholders,” Saikia said. Franchises began disbanding shortly after the announcement, with players and staff booking early departures. A revised schedule will be shared after further assessment in coordination with the authorities, according to the statement. All participants agreed that continuing the tournament under current conditions was not viable. Thursday's IPL match was abandoned midway after fighting began in India's border regions, but the cricket board attributed the disruption to a power failure at the stadium in the hill city of Dharamsala. The world's richest cricket tournament began its current season on March 22, and the final fixture was scheduled to be played on May 25, with matches being spread over 13 venues across the country. The nuclear-armed neighbours have been locked in conflict since Wednesday, when India targeted multiple locations in Pakistan, claiming they were ""terrorist infrastructure"" in response to a deadly attack in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir last month. New Delhi accused Islamabad of being involved in the Pahalgam attack, a charge Pakistan denied and sought an independent probe. Pakistan responded to the Indian airstrikes with heavy artillery fire and both sides accused each other on Thursday of carrying out waves of drone attacks. The UAE has refused to host the remaining IPL 2025 matches in Dubai due to a prior commitment with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Sources confirmed that India reportedly reached out to the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) with a request to host the remaining IPL 2025 fixtures in the UAE. However, it was revealed that the PCB had already secured the Dubai venue for the remaining matches of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) 10. The PCB finalised these arrangements on the night of May 8th, with an official announcement being made shortly afterward. Upon receiving the Indian board's request, the ECB informed the BCCI that the venue was already reserved for PSL 10, leaving the IPL plans in limbo. As a result, the UAE has indefinitely postponed its decision to host IPL matches, citing the unavailability of the Dubai venue. The Indian board is reportedly exploring the September window to host the remaining IPL matches after the tournament was officially suspended due to unforeseen circumstances. However, Indian media have noted that this could potentially clash with the upcoming Asia Cup 2025, raising logistical concerns for both tournaments."

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) put off the 2025 IPL “with immediate effect for one week” in the wake of the ongoing situation with Pakistan, according to a statement by BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia. Franchises began disbanding shortly after the announcement, with players and staff booking early departures, AFP reported. Sources indicate that various contingency plans were discussed, including moving matches to neutral venues, before the board opted to pause the tournament. Prior to the suspension, IPL 2025 had completed 58 matches, including the abandoned game in Dharamsala. Meanwhile, Australian media reported that several players are reportedly looking for flights out of India, with departures possible as soon as Saturday. The uncertainty intensified following Thursday's abandoned match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala, which left players distressed and concerned for their safety. A total of 15 Australian players are currently involved in IPL 2025, including Test captain Pat Cummins and star pacer Mitchell Starc. Former Australian captains Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer are also in India in coaching roles. Separately, Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association were in regular contact with players, providing support and advice as the situation evolved. CA’s chair Mike Baird and chief executive, Todd Greenberg, hosted a scheduled board meeting in Melbourne on Friday. The safety and welfare of our players and staff is always a core priority, and we support today’s decision by the BCCI,” Greenberg said in a statement. “We continue to work closely with the Australian government, PCB and BCCI and are maintaining regular communication with players and support staff in both India and Pakistan,” he added. While no timeline has been set for the tournament’s resumption, the BCCI is reportedly considering a potential window in August–September. However, this could disrupt India’s upcoming tour of Bangladesh and the Asia Cup, both of which now face uncertainty due to the ongoing regional tensions and strained diplomatic ties with Bangladesh."

The decision follows a significant spike in hostilities along the Line of Control (LoC), including the incursion of 78 Indian drones and the firing of surface-to-surface missiles, which the PCB termed as “reckless aggression” from India. The move to suspend the tournament was taken on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, ""who has kept in view the reckless aggression from India that has escalated to a point where national attention and sentiments are rightly focused on the courageous efforts of the Armed Forces of Pakistan who are vociferously upholding the sovereignty of our beloved Pakistan."" “In such times, while cricket unites and brings joy, it must take a respectful pause,” the board said. The PCB expressed full solidarity with the families of martyrs and security personnel, and thanked all stakeholders — franchises, players, sponsors, broadcasters, and fans — for their continued support during the tournament. The board also acknowledged the emotional toll on players, particularly foreign cricketers, and respected the concerns of their families seeking their safe return home. The latest escalation in the decades-old Pakistan-India rivalry began on May 7 when at least 31 civilians were killed in an unprovoked Indian cross-border attack. In retaliation, Pakistan downed its five fighter jets, including three Rafale, and dozens of drones. Meanwhile, India continues to send drones into Pakistani territory, with the military shooting down nearly 80, including Israeli-made IAI Heron — medium-altitude, long-endurance — unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The postponement came when the PSL 10 was in its final stage, with only eight matches remaining. After 27 matches, Quetta Gladiators, already qualified for the playoffs, lead the points table with six wins, two losses and one no result from nine matches. Karachi Kings are in second place with 10 points, having secured five wins and three losses in eight matches. Defending champions Islamabad United sit in third position, also with 10 points, following five wins and four losses from nine games. Lahore Qalandars are in fourth place with nine points, having secured four wins, four losses, and one no-result. Peshawar Zalmi are in fifth position with eight points from four wins in nine matches. Multan Sultans have been eliminated from playoff contention after securing only one win and suffering eight defeats in their nine matches."

The Neeraj Chopra Classic on May 24, a World Athletics Gold category meet, was set to feature a host of international names including Anderson Peters, Julius Yego, Thomas Roehler and Curtis Thompson. Chopra's move came after cricket-mad India and Pakistan suspended their elite Twenty20 leagues on Friday in the wake of the ongoing conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours. ""This decision has been made after careful thought and consultation, with the wellbeing of athletes, stakeholders, and the broader community as the top priority,"" Chopra's team announced on social media on Friday. ""We believe in the unifying power of sport. But, in this critical moment, standing firm with the nation matters most. All our gratitude and thoughts at this point are only with our Armed Forces, who are at the forefront for our nation."" Chopra said late last month it was ""completely out of the question"" that rival and Paris Olympics gold medallist Arshad Nadeem of Pakistan would attend the meet following a deadly militant attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The two countries have clashed since India struck multiple locations in Pakistan on Wednesday that it claimed were ""terrorist camps"", in retaliation for the attack in Kashmir, without providing a shred of evidence. Pakistan has denied the accusation, terming it a blatant lie. Chopra, who won gold at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, said a revised schedule for his event would be provided in due course."

In a statement released on Saturday, the BCB stressed that ensuring the safety and security of its players and support staff remains paramount. ""The BCB wishes to reiterate that the safety and security of its players and support staff remain the Board's highest priority,"" the statement read. ""All decisions concerning the tour will be made with careful consideration of the current situation in Pakistan, ensuring they align with the best interests of the team and Bangladesh cricket,"" it further said. Bangladesh are scheduled to arrive in Pakistan on May 21 to play five T20Is in Lahore and Faisalabad, with the series expected to begin on May 25. However, tensions along the India-Pakistan border cast uncertainty over the tour. The Bangladesh team is set to travel to Dubai later this week as part of their tour preparations. Meanwhile, Bangladesh cricketers Rishad Hossain and Nahid Rana — who were involved in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2025 before it was postponed indefinitely — returned home on Friday. Rishad, who represented Lahore Qalandars, and Rana, who played for Peshawar Zalmi, arrived in Dhaka on Friday evening. They are expected to depart for the UAE along with the rest of the Bangladesh squad on Wednesday. Given Bangladesh's upcoming international commitments, it is unlikely that the duo will rejoin the PSL if it resumes in the near future. The PSL 10 season was abruptly suspended with eight matches still remaining, amid heightened regional tensions. The series between Bangladesh and Pakistan now hangs in the balance as uncertainty looms. According to sources quoted by Geo News , the remaining PSL matches are likely to be held in Rawalpindi. PSL authorities have advised franchises to keep their overseas players in Dubai and asked local players to remain ready for action. Efforts are reportedly underway to gather all six teams in Islamabad, with Rawalpindi being considered the frontrunner to host the remainder of the tournament. The developments follow the Pakistan Cricket Board’s decision to suspend PSL 10 indefinitely, in compliance with directives from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The BCB had already announced its squad on May 4 for the five-match T20I series, which included both the UAE and Pakistan legs of the tour. Litton Das was named captain, with off-spinner Mahedi Hasan appointed as vice-captain. Bangladesh squad for T20Is in UAE and Pakistan: Litton Das (c), Tanzid Hasan, Parvez Hossain, Soumya Sarkar, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain, Jaker Ali, Rishad Hossain, Mahedi Hasan (vice-capt), Tanvir Islam, Mustafizur Rahman, Hasan Mahmud, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Nahid Rana and Shoriful Islam"
Mohammad Abbas dedicates five-wicket Haul to Pakistan armed forces,"May 11, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/604059-mohammad-abbas-dedicates-five-wicket-haul-to-pakistan-armed-forces,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-11/604059_3534716_updates.jpg,"NOTTINGHAM: Pakistan’s premier red ball fast bowler Mohammad Abbas dedicated his Nottinghamshire debut performance in the county championship to the Pakistani armed forces who gave a befitting response to Indian aggression. The fast bowler ripped through the opponent Hampshire’s batting line up in the first innings with figures of 5 for 31 in 15 overs, playing a pivotal role in bundling out Hampshire for 196 at Trent Bridge. His devastating seam bowling spell handed Nottinghamshire a significant 137-run lead in the ongoing County Championship Division One match. Speaking to Geo News , Abbas said, “First of all I want to thank Almighty Allah that I managed to get a five-wicket haul in the first innings of my debut game for Nottinghamshire. I have previous experience of playing at this ground. There is some help for seamers in the pitch with the new ball, so I am really happy to get a fiver.” In a poignant moment which perfectly aligned his successful Nottinghamshire debut with Pakistani forces victory over India, the fast bowler dedicated his stellar performance to the Pakistani military. “I want to dedicate this performance to our brave Pakistani forces — the army, navy, and air force — who, stationed at the country’s borders even at this moment, have been fighting with such valour and bravery against the enemy forces,"" said Abbas. ""We Pakistanis want peace in this world and with our neighbouring countries. But if we are forced into war again and again, then the way our armed forces have retaliated on this occasion, I am sure they will continue to respond in the same manner in any further misadventures by the Indian forces."" The 34-year-old was quick to acknowledge the support of his teammates and the management, including head coach Peter Moores and captain Haseeb Hameed. “Everyone in the team is happy with my performance. Even my pals in the Hampshire team appreciated it, since I’ve played for them in the past three seasons and I know their strengths and weaknesses. Wherever I play, I try to give my hundred percent.” Abbas’s return to Nottinghamshire had been long awaited. He initially signed with the club in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic delayed his debut. After four successful seasons with Hampshire, during which he claimed 180 red-ball wickets, the baller rejoined Nottinghamshire on a six-match deal."

Taking to his Instagram account, Sadpara announced: “Alhamdulillah, Dhaulagiri summit without oxygen and unsupported yesterday 10 May.” A post shared by Sajid Ali Sadpara (@sajidalisadpara) According to Karrar Haidri, Secretary, Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP), this extraordinary accomplishment was made possible with the support of Seven Summit Treks Nepal and Sabroso Pakistan, with technical climbing gear proudly sponsored by Kailas. He said it is a proud and historic moment for Pakistan and the global mountaineering community. In 2023, Sadpara achieved the unique feat of climbing the world’s highest peak Mount Everest without the support of supplementary oxygen and assistance from Sherpas in May 2023. He is the first Pakistani to climb the world’s high peak without the aid of supplemental oxygen. It is pertinent to mention here that Sadpara has climbed all five eight-thousanders in Pakistan without any help of supplementary oxygen. He successfully climbed Nanga Parbat without the help of supplementary oxygen and Sherpas in June 2023. He also summited K2 (8,611m), Gasherbrum-I (8,080m), and Gasherbrum-II (8,035m) in Pakistan, as well as Manaslu (8,163m) in Nepal, without supplemental oxygen. — Additional input from APP"

""India´s water used to go outside, now it will flow for India"", Modi said in a speech in New Delhi. ""India´s water will be stopped for India´s interests, and it will he utilised for India."" Pakistan has warned that tampering with its rivers would be considered ""an act of war"". Modi did not mention Islamabad specifically, but his speech comes after New Delhi suspended its part of the IWT, signed in 1960, which governs water critical to Pakistan for consumption and agriculture. New Delhi has blamed Islamabad for backing a deadly attack on tourists in Pahalaga, a mountain resort in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) last month, sparking a series of heated threats and diplomatic tit-for-tat measures. Pakistan rejects the accusations, and the two sides have exchanged nightly gunfire since April 24 along the Line of Control (LoC), according to the Indian army. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres on Monday said relations between Pakistan and India had reached a ""boiling point"", warning that ""now is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink"" of war. India on Tuesday altered the flow of the Chenab River, one of three rivers placed under Pakistan´s control according to the now-suspended treaty. ""We have witnessed changes in the river (Chenab) which are not natural at all,"" Kazim Pirzada, Punjab irrigation minister, told AFP. Punjab, bordering India and home to nearly half of Pakistan's 240 million citizens, is the country's agricultural heartland, and ""the majority impact will be felt in areas which have fewer alternate water routes,"" Pirzada warned. ""One day the river had normal inflow and the next day it was greatly reduced,"" Pirzada added. In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, large quantities of water from India were reportedly released on April 26, according to the Jinnah Institute, a think tank led by a former Pakistani climate change minister. ""This is being done so that we don't get to utilise the water,"" Pirzada added. Hindu-nationalist Modi had already threatened to use water as a weapon in 2016 after an attack in IIOJK. ""Blood and water cannot flow together,"" he said at the time. But India also is a downstream state of China, which controls the Tibetan headwaters of the Brahmaputra, the vast river key to India's northeast, and which then flows down through Bangladesh."

""It's a shame, we just heard about it,"" Trump said at the White House, after the Indian government claimed it had hit ""terrorist camps"" on its western neighbour's territory following a deadly attack on tourists in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). ""I guess people knew something was going to happen based on the past. They've been fighting for many, many decades and centuries, actually, if you really think about it,"" he added. ""I just hope it ends very quickly,"" said Trump. Meanwhile, the US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, in a brief statement, said: ""The US is keeping a close watch on the swiftly changing situation between Pakistan and India after the attacks by the Indian forces."" India had been widely expected to respond militarily since gunmen shot dead 26 people in IIOJK. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director-General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on early Wednesday that at least eight Pakistanis were martyred and 35 were injured in Indian missile attacks on cities in Punjab and Azad Kashmir. The Pakistan armed forces, in retaliatory strikes, shot down three Indian Air Force (IAF) jets and destroyed a brigade headquarters. ""Pakistani armed forces are giving a befitting response to Indian aggression,"" Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director-General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said. Pakistan Army destroyed an Indian Army brigade headquarters, according to security sources. A missile strike by Pakistani forces also wiped out an enemy post in the Dhundial sector of the Line of Control (LoC), the sources added. The Indian strikes came just hours after the US State Department issued a fresh call for calm. ""We continue to urge Pakistan and India to work towards a responsible resolution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia,"" State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters. Her statement came after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of stopping water from flowing across borders following the Kashmir attack."
Pakistan and India — a history of armed conflict,"May 07, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603449-pakistan-and-india-a-history-of-armed-conflict,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-07/603449_9118696_updates.jpg,"Long-running tensions between nuclear-armed rivals Pakistan and India soared Wednesday after New Delhi launched deadly strikes at Pakistani territory. The missiles killed at least 31 people, according to Pakistan, which said it had begun retaliating in a major escalation between the South Asian neighbours. India accuses Pakistan of backing the deadliest attack in years on civilians in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) on April 22, in which 26 people were killed. Islamabad has rejected the charge. Both countries have since exchanged gunfire along the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that separates Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) from IIOJK, a heavily fortified zone of disputed Himalayan outposts. Meanwhile, India has expelled citizens and ordered the border shut. The two sides have fought multiple conflicts — ranging from skirmishes to all-out war — since their bloody partition in 1947. 1947: Partition Two centuries of British rule ended on August 15, 1947, with the sub-continent divided into mainly Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu India. The poorly prepared Partition unleashes bloodshed that kills possibly more than a million people and displaces 15 million others. As the princely state of Kashmir hesitates between joining India or Pakistan, tensions rise. A UN-backed, 770-kilometre (480-mile) ceasefire line in January 1949 divides Kashmir. 1965: Kashmir Pakistan launches a second war in August 1965 when it tries to reclaim IIOJK. Thousands are killed before a September ceasefire brokered by the Soviet Union and the United States. 1971: Bangladesh Pakistan deploys troops in 1971 to suppress an independence movement in what is now Bangladesh, which it had governed since 1947 as East Pakistan. An estimated three million people are killed in the nine-month conflict and millions flee into India. India invades, leading to the creation of the independent nation of Bangladesh. 1989-90: Kashmir An uprising breaks out in IIOJK in 1989 as grievances at the disputed territory boil over. Tens of thousands of soldiers, freedom fighters and civilians are killed in the following decades. India accuses Pakistan of funding the fighters and aiding their weapons training. 1999: Kargil Pakistan seizes Indian military posts in the icy heights of the Kargil mountains. Pakistan yields after severe pressure from Washington, alarmed by intelligence reports showing Islamabad had deployed part of its nuclear arsenal nearer to the conflict. At least 1,000 people are killed over 10 weeks. 2019: Kashmir A suicide attack on a convoy of Indian security forces kills 40 in Pulwama. India, which is busy with campaigning for general elections, sends fighter jets which carry out air strikes on Pakistani territory. One Indian jet is shot down over AJK, with the pilot, Indian Air Force (IAF) Wing Commander Abhinandan, captured. He was captured by Pakistan after his MiG 21 Bison aircraft was shot down by a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) jet.  He was handed over in a gesture of peace to India at the Wagah border."

Among the destroyed Indian Air Force (IAF) jets are three French-made Rafales, one Su30MKI and one MIG-29 Fulcrum, confirmed a military spokesperson to Reuters . Following the escalating aggression between both the countries after India's attack, world leaders, UN officials and International Community have expressed deep concerns. US President Donald Trump said he hoped clashes between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan end ""very quickly,"" after New Delhi's forces launched strikes and Islamabad vowed retaliation. He termed rising tension between India and Pakistan a ""shame"". ""It's a shame, we just heard about it,"" Trump said at the White House.

""He is encouraging India and Pakistan to re-open a channel between their leadership to defuse the situation and prevent further escalation,"" said US National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes in a statement, after India carried out air strikes on Pakistani soil. Moreover, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was ""very concerned"" about Indian military strikes on Pakistan, his spokesperson said on Tuesday, hours after India said it hit nine sites in Pakistani territory. ""The Secretary-General is very concerned about the Indian military operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls for maximum military restraint from both countries. The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,"" said spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. Additionally, China called on both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and put peace and stability first, its foreign ministry said in response to the military escalation between the South Asian countries. The Chinese ministry said in a statement it regrets India's military action and is concerned about the current situation. Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan contacted his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar by telephone to express solidarity over India’s unprovoked aggression, the Foreign Office said on Tuesday. According to FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan, Fidan conveyed deep concern over the worsening regional security situation. Both ministers agreed to stay in close contact as developments unfold. Furthermore, Russia's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that it was deeply concerned about the deepening military confrontation between India and Pakistan, and that it called for both countries to show restraint. Russia has warm relations with both India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan have fought three full-scale wars since gaining independence from the British in 1947."
Comment: Attacks cloud India's nascent safe haven status,"May 07, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603475-attacks-cloud-indias-nascent-safe-haven-status,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-07/603475_8462563_updates.jpg,"Skirmishes between India and Pakistan are not new. But the rich world's stake in South Asia is rapidly increasing. That makes the risk of a conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours harder to ignore for countries, executives and investors betting on the world's fifth-largest economy emerging from the global trade war as some kind of safe haven. On Wednesday, hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a landmark trade deal with the UK and trumpeted his country's transformation into a vibrant hub of global commerce, India said it attacked nine ""terrorist infrastructure"" sites in Pakistan. It's a jarring juxtaposition of economic and political events. A muscular response from New Delhi was expected after an attack on tourists killed 26 people in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) last month. That explains why Indian stock, bond and currency traders barely flinched on Wednesday morning local time: the Nifty 50 index rebounded after starting in the red, 10-year government bond yields traded flat, and the rupee recovered some of its opening losses. The less developed markets in Karachi were more skittish. India also has a high tolerance for geopolitical risk. One concern, however, is that New Delhi may not achieve its desired deterrence. Unsurprisingly, Pakistan's army warns it will respond. Over the longer term, India's suspension of a long-standing water-sharing treaty that ensured supply to 80% of Pakistani farms threatens to turbocharge poverty and fuel further violence. Underscoring the lingering risks, several Indian states were due to conduct security drills on Wednesday to test civil preparedness, prompting multinational companies with global research and back office operations in the country to plan for the risk of power outages. It's a sobering moment for those counting on India to capture a bigger share of American supply chains from China – Apple aims to make most of its United States-bound iPhones in India by the end of 2026. What's more, although the US has not been a useful policeman of world order for some time, the danger of a conflict between India and Pakistan escalating may be higher under a chaotic administration in Washington. New Delhi has the most to lose from a protracted standoff. Despite some progress in seizing its moment on the global stage, the country remains a highly regulated, inefficient and complex market where overall foreign direct investment is falling as a share of GDP. Among emerging markets, India has suffered some of the most selling by foreign institutional investors so far this year. Heightened tensions with Pakistan provide another reason for the undecided to look away."
"Airlines re-route, cancel flights due to Pakistan-India fighting","May 07, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603510-airlines-re-route-cancel-flights-due-to-pakistan-india-fighting,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-07/603510_9704842_updates.jpg,"TAIPEI/NEW DELHI: Airlines including United Airlines and Korean Air re-routed or cancelled flights and about a dozen Indian airports were shut on Wednesday after India staged a reprisal attack on Pakistan that raised fears of an escalation. India attacked Azad Kashmir and Pakistan said it had shot down five Indian fighter jets in the flare-up, which followed an attack that killed 26 people in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir(IIOJK) last month. Images from flight tracking websites showed a long line of airlines passing over Oman, UAE and Kuwait after the attack, raising the possibility of airspace congestion. Authorities in Pakistan said 57 international flights were in the country's airspace when India struck. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's office said India's action ""caused grave danger to commercial airlines"" belonging to Gulf countries and ""endangered lives"". India's civil aviation ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Pakistan’s remarks. In the last few days, India and Pakistan have shut their airspaces to each other’s airlines. Global airlines like Lufthansa have also been avoiding Pakistan's airspace. Domestic flights in both countries were also disrupted. 3 % of scheduled flights in India and 17% of scheduled flights in Pakistan were cancelled as of 1030 GMT, according to Flightradar24. India's top airline, IndiGo, said it was cancelling 165 flights till Saturday morning. Its shares were down 1.1%. Flights belonging to Air India, SpiceJet and Akasa Air were also cancelled. Pakistan said its airspace was open following closure after the attacks and that its airports were ""fully functional."" Images from FlightRadar24 showed some civilian jets flying over Pakistan airspace but India's northwest continued to be deserted. The changing airline schedules are set to further complicate operations in the Middle East and South Asia regions for carriers, which are already grappling with the fallout from conflicts in the two regions. A spokesperson for Dutch airline KLM said it was not flying over Pakistan until further notice. Singapore Airlines said it had stopped flying over Pakistani airspace since May 6. Korean Air said it had begun rerouting its Seoul Incheon–Dubai flights on Wednesday, opting for a southern route that passes over Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India, instead of the previous path through Pakistani airspace. United Airlines said it had cancelled its flight to Delhi, citing in part ""airspace limitations"". The US airline operates one direct flight from Newark to New Delhi. Thai Airways said flights to destinations in Europe and South Asia would be rerouted starting early on Wednesday morning, while Taiwan's China Airlines said flights to and from destinations including London, Frankfurt and Rome had been disrupted. Flights from India to Europe were also seen taking longer routes. Lufthansa flight LH761 from Delhi to Frankfurt took about half an hour more to reach its destination compared to Tuesday, according to FlightRadar24. The Association of Asia Pacific Airlines voiced concern over the impact of conflicts on airline operations. ""Apart from cost and operational disruption, there are safety concerns as GPS spoofing interfering with flight operations over conflict zones is one of the highest risks the industry faces,"" it said in a statement. GPS spoofing is a malicious technique that manipulates Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which can send commercial airliners off course."
Black smoke signals no pope elected in first conclave vote,"May 08, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603546-black-smoke-signals-no-pope-elected-in-first-conclave-vote,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-08/603546_9923361_updates.jpg,"Black smoke billowed from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday evening, signalling an inconclusive first vote by cardinals locked in the Sistine Chapel in a conclave to elect a new pope to guide the Roman Catholic Church. Thousands of faithful gathered in St Peter's Square waiting for smoke to pour from a narrow flue on the roof of the chapel at the end of a day rich in ritual and pageantry, with prelates praying for divine guidance in their secret ballot. The crowds had to be patient as it took longer than expected for the smoke to appear, more than three hours after the start of the conclave. This was an hour more than it took for smoke to be seen after the first vote in the 2013 conclave that picked the late Pope Francis. When a pope is chosen, white smoke will emerge, but this had not been expected on Wednesday - a pontiff has not been picked on the first day of a conclave in modern times. However, some cardinals said this week that they hoped to wrap things up by Thursday or Friday to show the Church can remain unified after the often divisive, 12-year papacy of Francis, who died last month. The 133 cardinal electors, who are all aged under 80, will spend the night secluded in one of two Vatican guesthouses - where they can continue their deliberations in a more informal setting before returning to the chapel on Thursday morning. Following Wednesday's single round of voting, the red-hatted ""princes of the Church"" will hold two votes in the morning session and two in the afternoon, continuing in coming days until one man has secured a majority of at least two-thirds - 89 cardinals this time around. Their only communication with the outside world will be the smoke from the chimney as they burn their completed ballot papers mixed with special chemicals - black when a voting session ends with no result, white when a pontiff is elected. Modern papal conclaves are typically short. The 2013 conclave lasted just two days, likewise in 2005 when his predecessor, Benedict XVI, was picked. In recent days, cardinals have offered different assessments of what they are looking for in the next pontiff who will lead the 1.4-billion-member Church. While some have called for continuity with Francis' vision of greater openness and reform, others have said they want to turn the clock back and embrace old traditions. Many have indicated they want a more predictable, measured pontificate. 'Good of the Church' In a sermon ahead of the conclave, Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who at 91 is too old to take part in the vote, told his fellow prelates they must set aside ""every personal consideration"" in choosing the new pontiff and keep in mind ""only ... the good of the Church and of humanity"". He also suggested the next pope had to respect diversity within the Church. ""Unity does not mean uniformity, but a firm and profound communion in diversity,"" he said. No clear favourite has emerged, although Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle are considered the front-runners. However, if it quickly becomes obvious that neither can win, votes are likely to shift to other contenders, with the electors possibly coalescing around geography, doctrinal affinity or common languages. Among other potential candidates are France's Jean-Marc Aveline, Hungary's Peter Erdo, American Robert Prevost and Italy's Pierbattista Pizzaballa. A record 133 cardinals from 70 countries entered the Sistine Chapel, up from 115 from 48 nations in the last conclave in 2013 - a growth that reflects efforts by Francis during his 12-year reign to extend the geographical reach of the Church. Among their considerations will be whether they should seek a pope from the global South, where congregations are growing, as they did in 2013 with Francis, from Argentina, or hand back the reins to Europe, or even pick a first US pope. Latin chants and organ music accompanied the cardinals as they processed into the frescoed Sistine Chapel before the conclave began, with Michelangelo's depiction of Christ delivering the Last Judgment dominating the 500-year-old room. They laid their hands on the Gospels, taking a vow of secrecy not to divulge anything about their gathering. Archbishop Diego Ravelli, the Vatican's master of ceremonies, then pronounced the Latin command ""Extra omnes!"" (Everyone out!) telling those not involved in the gathering to leave the room, with the chapel's heavy wooden doors slamming shut on the outside world. There is not meant to be any discussion in the voting sessions, but experience suggests there will be plenty of covert campaigning during breaks and meals as the names of ""papabili"" rise and fall in successive ballots."

A spokesperson for Russia's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, rejected any suggestion that Moscow had opposed or was hindering efforts to introduce a ceasefire. Both were speaking hours before a three-day ceasefire proposed by Russia was to go into effect to mark the anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. ""Ukraine's proposal to cease strikes and establish at least a 30-day ceasefire remains in force,"" Zelenskiy said in a nightly video address. ""We are not withdrawing this proposal, which could give diplomacy a chance."" Zelenskiy also appeared to acknowledge the numerous drone attacks that have been targeting Russian sites, including the city of Moscow, as the World War Two commemorations approached. ""It is absolutely fair that Russian skies, the skies of the aggressor, are also not calm today, in a mirror-like way,"" he said. Russia, he said, had made no response to the 30-day offer ""except for new strikes. This clearly and obviously demonstrates to everyone who the source of the war is."" The US proposed the 30-day ceasefire in March and Ukraine agreed. Russia has said such a measure could only be introduced after mechanisms to enforce and uphold it are put in place. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia had observed a separate 30-day moratorium on attacks on energy sites and had also observed a ceasefire to coincide with the observance of Orthodox Easter last month. ""The only obstacle to the ceasefire is Kyiv, which violates agreements and is unwilling to seriously discuss the terms of a long-term ceasefire,"" Zakharova said in response to comments by US envoy Keith Kellogg. ""Russia has never been opposed to a ceasefire. All the more so, we have done this twice,"" Zakharova said in a comment posted on the Foreign Ministry's website. ""Having Kyiv observe them could have been a step towards a long-term ceasefire. Unfortunately, Kyiv sabotaged both. The Ukrainian military violated the moratorium 135 times and the Easter ceasefire nearly 5,000 times."""
"With Pakistan-India, Trump turns back to cautious US diplomacy","May 08, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603557-with-pakistan-india-trump-turns-back-to-cautious-us-diplomacy,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-08/603557_5516351_updates.jpg,"President Donald Trump has been shaking up how the United States does business in the world. But with the violence between Pakistan and India, Trump has marked a return to a traditional, and even cautious, diplomacy. The US across successive administrations has sought to build ties with India and Trump voiced solidarity after gunmen killed 26 people in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). Trump did not criticise India after it carried out strikes against Pakistan but has pleaded for a quick resolution. ""It's so terrible,"" Trump said on Wednesday. ""I get along with both. I know both very well, and I want to see them work it out. I want to see them stop."" India briefed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also interim national security advisor, on the overnight strikes. After the Pahalgam attack, Rubio spoke to Pakistan's prime minister to urge condemnation and cooperation but also asked India's foreign minister to avoid escalation. Lisa Curtis, who was the National Security Council senior director on South Asia during Trump's first term, said the United States remained unique in its influence on both sides. ""There are other countries that are worried and may be in touch with their Indian and Pakistani counterparts, but when it comes down to it, it is the role and responsibility of the United States to help the countries find a face-saving way out of the crisis,"" said Curtis, now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. In 2019, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also ordered strikes after a deadly attack. Mike Pompeo, then Trump's secretary of state, later said that he defused tensions after an Indian official contacted him to voice suspicion that Pakistan was readying a nuclear strike. ""I do not think the world properly knows just how close the India-Pakistan rivalry came to spilling over into a nuclear conflagration,"" Pompeo wrote in his memoir. Trump has largely sidelined career diplomats since his return, relying on his friend Steve Witkoff to crisscross the globe. Trump has so far failed in his quest to quickly end the Ukraine war, with Witkoff still pursuing diplomacy with Iran and recently reaching a deal with Yemen's Huthi rebels. ""The Trump administration has several global crises to deal with currently and would like to avoid another one right now,"" said Aparna Pande, a research fellow at the Hudson Institute. ""The Trump administration would also like the focus to remain on trade and commerce and the competition with China and any conflict detracts India, a partner in this endeavor, away from these efforts,"" she said."
Meta blocks top Muslim news page in India at govt request,"May 08, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603570-meta-blocks-top-muslim-news-page-in-india-at-govt-request,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-08/603570_1985431_updates.jpg,"WASHINGTON: Meta has banned a prominent Muslim news page on Instagram in India at the government’s request, the account’s founder said Wednesday, denouncing the move as “censorship” as hostilities escalate between India and Pakistan. Instagram users in India trying to access posts from the handle @Muslim – a page with 6.7 million followers – were met with a message stating: “Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content.” There was no immediate reaction from the Indian government on the ban, which comes after access was blocked to the social media accounts of Pakistani actors and cricketers. “I received hundreds of messages, emails and comments from our followers in India, that they cannot access our account,” Ameer Al-Khatahtbeh, the news account’s founder and editor-in-chief, said in a statement. “Meta has blocked the @Muslim account by legal request of the Indian government. This is censorship.” Meta declined to comment. A spokesman for the tech giant directed AFP to a company webpage outlining its policy for restricting content when governments believe material on its platforms goes “against local law.” The development, first reported by the US tech journalist Taylor Lorenz’s outlet User Magazine, comes in the wake of the worst violence between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan in two decades. Both countries have exchanged heavy artillery fire along their contested frontier, after New Delhi launched deadly missile strikes on its arch-rival. At least 43 deaths were reported in the fighting, which came two weeks after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for backing a deadly attack on tourists in the Indian-run side of the disputed Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. Pakistan rejects the charge and has warned it will “avenge” those killed by Indian air strikes. The @Muslim account is among the most followed Muslim news sources on Instagram. Khatahtbeh apologised to followers in India, adding: “When platforms and countries try to silence media, it tells us that we are doing our job in holding those in power accountable.” “We will continue to document the truth and stand out firmly for justice,” he added, while calling on Meta to reinstate the account in India. India has also banned more than a dozen Pakistani YouTube channels for allegedly spreading “provocative” content, including Pakistani news outlets. In recent days, access to the Instagram account of Pakistan’s former prime minister and cricket captain Imran Khan has also been blocked in India. Pakistani Bollywood movie regulars Fawad Khan and Atif Aslam were also off limits in India, as well as a wide range of cricketers – including star batters Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan and retired players Shahid Afridi and Wasim Akram. Rising hostilities between the South Asian neighbours have also unleashed an avalanche of online misinformation, with social media users circulating everything from deepfake videos to outdated images from unrelated conflicts, falsely linking them to the Indian strikes. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump called for India and Pakistan to immediately halt their fighting, and offered to help end the violence."
Right-wing One America News to provide newsfeed to Voice of America,"May 08, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603577-right-wing-one-america-news-to-provide-newsfeed-to-voice-of-america,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-08/603577_5079978_updates.jpg,"NEW YORK: The far-right One America News Network will provide “newsfeed services” to Voice of America (VOA) and other US government-funded media outlets, according to Kari Lake, senior advisor to the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) , VOA’s parent company. In a post on X on Tuesday, Lake said the network, which features content that is consistently supportive of President Donald Trump, would provide its news and video service free of charge. The OAN partnership has angered VOA journalists, many of whom have been terminated after Trump began his second term in January as part of his administration's efforts to shrink the federal payroll and silence any perceived criticism of his policies. “What they have done, in effect, is replace our 83-year legacy of producing reliable, authoritative news with the hard work and commitment of countless journalists with a contract to outsource our news-gathering to a source that is clearly partisan,” said VOA White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara, who is on indefinite leave. OAN , owned by San Diego-based Herring Networks, was the target of defamation lawsuits over its false claims that Trump won the 2020 presidential election. Since his election in 2024, Trump has continued to make such claims. Representatives for the USAGM and OAN did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In March, Trump ordered the gutting of USAGM and Lake placed nearly all VOA employees on leave. She said the agency was ""irretrievably broken"" and biased against Trump, with a “product that often parrots the talking-points of America’s adversaries.” Lake, a former television news anchor who was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Arizona governor and US senator, has moved to cancel contracts with wire services including Reuters , the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse , according to a March 13 X post. At the time, she wrote that the agency should produce its own news content rather than pay outside companies. Widakuswara and a group of VOA employees sued Lake and the Trump administration, claiming that by terminating and threatening to terminate the majority of USAGM staff, they violated their First Amendment rights. A federal appeals court on Saturday blocked a ruling that had ordered the Trump administration to put more than 1,000 VOA employees back to work."
"'No one wins in war', says UK WWII veteran and yoga teacher at 100","May 08, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603581-no-one-wins-in-war-says-uk-wwii-veteran-and-yoga-teacher-at-100,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-08/603581_3798595_updates.jpg,"HARLOW, United Kingdom: Centenarian Dorothea Barron recalled the wave of relief she felt when she heard World War II had finally come to an end. ""Thank goodness that's over,"" the British Navy veteran remembers thinking. Eighty years on, the spritely 100-year-old — who now teaches yoga and saw in her big birthday with a celebratory flight in a Spitfire fighter plane — is among an ever-shrinking number of veterans with firsthand memories of the war. Exactly how many former WWII servicepeople there are in the UK is unknown. While experts estimate there are still several thousand, the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, marked on May 8, will be among the last major British wartime commemorations with a substantial veteran presence. As Britain marked the anniversary with four days of celebrations from Monday — including military parades, flypasts and street parties — Barron told AFP how it felt to hear that the war that had overshadowed her teenage years was over. The news came as ""a release, a tremendous weight off your shoulders"". But it also marked an abrupt shift for members of the armed forces. ""It was ‘keep the uniform, here are a few clothing coupons, a few food coupons, go home.’ And that was all,"" Barron said. Aged 20, she did not anticipate how tough life in post-war Britain would be. It was a ""terribly difficult"" period, Barron said. ""I won’t say unhappy, but there were uncertain times. You never knew what was going to hit you the next day."" Speaking from her home near Harlow, north of London, Barron went on to recall the years of post-war reconstruction with extraordinary vim. She has been teaching yoga for 60 years, and every Monday she holds a class close to her home. Her flexibility — as demonstrated by her downward dog pose, with heels on the floor and back perfectly flat — impresses even her young students. ""Can you feel it in the back of your legs?"" she asked at a recent class. ""If you want firm boobs, that’s the pose,"" she told her dozen or so students aged 20 to 95, unfazed by their groans. ""I feel lovely, relaxed and stretched,"" she said as she walked home afterwards. Barron celebrated her 100th birthday in October 2024 by flying in a Spitfire, a Royal Air Force aircraft that played a crucial role in the Battle of Britain in 1940 against the German Luftwaffe. ""It really was so wonderfully exciting,"" she said, beaming. With such energy today, it is easy to imagine Barron’s determination at 18. She ""desperately"" wanted to join the Women’s Royal Naval Service, or Wrens, as they were known. ""We weren’t going to have the Nazis taking over our country,"" she said. But Barron feared she was too short to make the cut. ""I cheated like mad and cut out cardboard heels to make me look taller, and I built my hair up, puffed it up,"" she said. ""I was only five foot two inches (157 centimetres), but I think they saw I was so keen to become a Wren that they thought ‘we’ll let her through’."" Barron taught troops how to communicate using visual signals and Morse code. And ahead of the D-Day Normandy landings, she helped test the portable Mulberry harbours, which were towed across the English Channel and allowed large numbers of troops and vehicles to reach France. But she did not know what the structures were for at the time, and only later realised how they were deployed. ""I was rather delighted,"" she said. ""I thought: ‘Oh, I did do something useful then’."" She planned to mark Victory in Europe Day in the Netherlands for Dutch Liberation Day, before taking part in a service at Westminster Abbey on May 8, which will also be attended by the British royal family. During the war, Barron met her husband Andrew, who was in the Royal Air Force. They had two daughters, and Barron is now a great-grandmother. Andrew died in 2021, and Barron still talks about him lovingly. It takes a lot to stop Barron from being cheerful, but she is concerned about current events — especially Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has left conflict raging in Europe once more. ""Nobody wins a war,"" she said."
Trump says he hopes India and Pakistan stop now after going 'tit-for-tat',"May 08, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603584-trump-says-he-hopes-india-and-pakistan-stop-now-after-going-tit-for-tat,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-08/603584_6611902_updates.jpg,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump offered to help Pakistan and India ease growing tensions and urged both nations to stop attacking each other and work towards peace. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said he was willing to step in and assist if needed. ""It's so terrible,"" Trump said at the White House. ""I get along with both, I know both very well, and I want to see them work it out. I want to see them stop. ""They've gone tit-for-tat, so hopefully they can stop now."" Trump's comments came as India and Pakistan exchanged heavy artillery fire along their contested frontier, after New Delhi launched deadly missile strikes on its arch-rival. At least 43 deaths were reported in the fighting, which came two weeks after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for backing an attack on the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, which Pakistan denied. Pakistan has long been a key US military ally but Trump has been keen to build up relations with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he hosted at the White House in February. ""We get along with both countries very well, good relationships with both, and I want to see it stop,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""And if I can do anything to help, I will be there."" Trump initially played down the crisis as part of old tensions between India and Pakistan — even saying they had been at odds for 1,500 years, despite the two countries only forming after independence from Britain in 1947. But his administration has scrambled into action in the last 24 hours since the Indian strikes. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to his counterparts from India and Pakistan on Friday, encouraging them to reopen dialogue to ""defuse"" the situation, the White House said."
Ukraine's cities quiet as Kremlin-sponsored ceasefire kicks in,"May 08, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603597-ukraines-cities-quiet-as-kremlin-sponsored-ceasefire-kicks-in,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-08/603597_2628611_updates.jpg,"A three-day ceasefire declared by Russia came into effect on Thursday morning with skies over Ukraine's major cities quiet, in a change from successive nights of heavy attacks by Russian drones and ballistic missiles. Ukraine's air force reported that after the start of the Kremlin-sponsored ceasefire Russian aircraft twice launched guided bombs on the Sumy region of northern Ukraine. There was no word on damage and Reuters could not independently verify the attacks. The Russian ceasefire, coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the World War Two defeat of Nazi Germany, went into effect at midnight Moscow time. As part of the anniversary events, Russian President Vladimir Putin is hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders in Moscow and will review a military parade on Moscow's Red Square on May 9. Ukraine has not committed to abide by the Kremlin's ceasefire, calling it a ruse by Putin to create the impression he wants to end the war, which began when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Putin says he is committed to achieving peace. Ukraine launched successive drone attacks on Moscow this week, which forced the closure of airports in the Russian capital and the grounding of airliners. Apart from the Ukrainian air force reports about the two launches of guided bombs, there were no reports in Ukraine of any Russian long-range drones or missiles being launched on Ukrainian cities early on Thursday. As of 3:45 am, the capital Kyiv was quiet, in contrast to 24 hours earlier when the city had reverberated with the sound of explosions from waves of Russian airborne attacks and outgoing Ukrainian anti-aircraft fire. It was not immediately clear if there was a pause in fighting on the frontlines between Russian and Ukrainian forces. A Reuters witness near the front in eastern Ukraine said early on Thursday he could hear no sounds of fighting. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday that his country stood by its offer to observe a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia. ""We are not withdrawing this proposal, which could give diplomacy a chance,"" Zelensky said in his nightly video address. Russia, he said, had made no response to the 30-day offer except for new strikes. ""This clearly and obviously demonstrates to everyone who the source of the war is,"" the Ukrainian president added. Zelensky also appeared to acknowledge the numerous drone attacks that have been targeting Russian sites, including the city of Moscow, as the World War Two commemorations approached. ""It is absolutely fair that Russian skies, the skies of the aggressor, are also not calm today, in a mirror-like way,"" he said on Wednesday. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, in a series of posts on the Telegram messaging app over five hours, said 14 drones headed for the capital had been repelled or destroyed. This happened before the Kremlin-sponsored three-day ceasefire took effect. The United States proposed the 30-day ceasefire in March and Ukraine agreed. Russia has said such a measure could only be introduced after mechanisms to enforce and uphold it are put in place. Both countries are under pressure from US President Donald Trump to bring a swift end to the war, the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed surprise at remarks from US envoy Keith Kellogg that Putin may be obstructing a comprehensive ceasefire. ""The only obstacle to the ceasefire is Kyiv, which violates agreements and is unwilling to seriously discuss the terms of a long-term ceasefire,"" Zakharova said."
Global temperatures stuck at near-record highs in April: EU monitor,"May 08, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603613-global-temperatures-stuck-at-near-record-highs-in-april-eu-monitor,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-08/603613_3078251_updates.jpg,"PARIS: Global temperatures were stuck at near-record highs in April, the EU's climate monitor said on Thursday, extending an unprecedented heat streak and raising questions about how quickly the world might be warming. The extraordinary heat spell was expected to subside as warmer El Nino conditions faded last year, but temperatures have stubbornly remained at record or near-record levels well into this year. ""And then comes 2025, when we should be settling back, and instead we are remaining at this accelerated step-change in warming,"" said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. ""And we seem to be stuck there. What this is caused (by) — what is explaining it — is not entirely resolved, but it’s a very worrying sign,"" he told AFP . In its latest bulletin, the Copernicus Climate Change Service said that April was the second-hottest in its dataset, which draws on billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations. All but one of the last 22 months exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the warming limit enshrined in the Paris agreement, beyond which major and lasting climate and environmental changes become more likely. Many scientists believe this target is no longer attainable and will be crossed in a matter of years. A large study by dozens of pre-eminent climate scientists, which has not yet been peer reviewed, recently concluded that global warming reached 1.36°C in 2024. Copernicus puts the current figure at 1.39°C and projects 1.5°C could be reached in mid-2029 or sooner based on the warming trend over the last 30 years. ""Now it’s in four years’ time. The reality is we will exceed 1.5 degrees,"" said Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs Copernicus. ""The critical thing is to then not latch onto two degrees, but to focus on 1.51,"" the climate scientist told AFP . Julien Cattiaux, a climate scientist at the French research institute CNRS, said 1.5°C ""would be beaten before 2030"" but that was not a reason to give up. ""It’s true that the figures we’re giving are alarming: the current rate of warming is high. They say every 10th of a degree counts, but right now, they’re passing quickly,"" he told AFP . ""Despite everything, we mustn’t let that hinder action."" Scientists are unanimous that burning fossil fuels has largely driven long-term global warming that has made extreme weather disasters more frequent and intense. But they are less certain about what else might have contributed to this persistent heat event. Experts think changes in global cloud patterns, airborne pollution and Earth’s ability to store carbon in natural sinks like forests and oceans, could be factors also contributing to the planet overheating. The surge pushed 2023 and then 2024 to become the hottest years on record, with 2025 tipped to be third. ""The last two years... have been exceptional,"" said Burgess. ""They’re still within the boundary — or the envelope — of what climate models predicted we could be in right now. But we’re at the upper end of that envelope."" She said that ""the current rate of warming has accelerated but whether that’s true over the long term, I’m not comfortable saying that"", adding that more data was needed. Copernicus records go back to 1940 but other sources of climate data — such as ice cores, tree rings and coral skeletons — allow scientists to expand their conclusions using evidence from much further into the past. Scientists say the current period is likely to be the warmest the Earth has been for the last 125,000 years."
"Cardinal Prevost elected Pope Leo XIV, first US pontiff","May 08, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603645-cardinal-prevost-elected-pope-leo-xiv-first-us-pontiff,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-08/603645_7613050_updates.jpg,"VATICAN CITY: Cardinal Robert Prevost was elected in a surprise choice to be the new leader of the Catholic Church on Thursday, taking the name Leo XIV, becoming the first US pontiff. Pope Leo, appeared on the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica around 70 minutes after white smoke billowed from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, signifying the 133 cardinal electors had chosen a new leader for the 1.4 billion-member Catholic Church. ""Peace be with you all,"" the new pope told the cheering crowd. The choice of Prevost was announced by French Cardinal Dominique Mamberti with the Latin words ""Habemus Papam"" (We have a pope) to tens of thousands of people gathered in St. Peter's Square to hear the news. Aged 69 and originally from Chicago, Prevost has spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru and became a cardinal only in 2023. He has given a few media interviews and rarely speaks in public. Leo becomes the 267th Catholic pope after the death last month of Pope Francis, who was the first Latin American pope and had led the Church for 12 years and widely sought to open the staid institution up to the modern world. Francis enacted a range of reforms and allowed debate on divisive issues such as women's ordination and better inclusion of LGBT Catholics. Ahead of the conclave, some cardinals called for continuity with Francis' vision of greater openness and reform, while others said they wanted to turn back the clock and embrace old traditions. Prevost has attracted interest from his peers because of his quiet style and support for Francis, especially his commitment to social justice issues. Prevost served as a bishop in Chiclayo, in northwestern Peru, from 2015 to 2023. Francis brought him to Rome that year to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops across the globe, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world's bishops. Prevost said during a 2023 Vatican press conference: ""Our work is to enlarge the tent and to let everyone know they are welcome inside the Church."" Pope Francis died on April 21 after ruling the 1.4-billion member Church for 12 years. During his reign he sought to open up the staid institution to the modern world, enacting a range of reforms and allowing debate on divisive issues such as women's ordination and better inclusion of LGBT Catholics. While no clear favourites had emerged to succeed him, Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who served as the Vatican's number two under Francis, and Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle were considered the frontrunners. Other ""papabili"" - potential papal candidates in Italian - were France's Jean-Marc Aveline, Hungary's Peter Erdo, American Robert Prevost, Italy's Pierbattista Pizzaballa and Filipino Pablo Virgilio David."

This development came a day after the PSL administration started working on a plan to resume PSL 10 matches following a ceasefire between Pakistan and India. The sources added that matches would be played in Rawalpindi and Lahore, whereas the final of the showpiece event would be played in Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium. However, it is expected that the upcoming matches would not be attended by foreign players ""due to their international schedule"", and the PSL franchises would resume matches with local players, they added. The sources revealed that the PSL administration needed to complete its season due to financial matters. A day ago, the PSL franchises were asked to keep foreign players in Dubai, signalling the resumption of the league. It was learnt that a plan was being considered to gather all teams in Islamabad, and the remaining matches are likely to be played at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. The PCB had announced the indefinite postponement of the remaining eight matches of the PSL Season 10 in light of the deteriorating regional security situation. The postponement came when the PSL 10 was in its final stage, with only eight matches remaining. After 27 matches, Quetta Gladiators, already qualified for the playoffs, led the points table with six wins, two losses, and one no result from nine matches. Karachi Kings are in second place with 10 points, having secured five wins and three losses in eight matches. Defending champions Islamabad United sit in third position, with 10 points, following five wins and four losses from nine games. Lahore Qalandars are in fourth place with nine points, having secured four wins, four losses, and one no-result. Peshawar Zalmi are in fifth position with eight points from four wins in nine matches. Multan Sultans have been eliminated from playoff contention after securing only one win and suffering eight defeats in their nine matches."
Global militaries to analyse Pakistan-India fighter jet clash,"May 09, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603743-global-militaries-to-analyse-pakistan-india-fighter-jet-clash,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-09/603743_579407_updates.jpg,"A dogfight between Chinese-made Pakistani jets and French-made Indian Rafale fighters will be closely scrutinised by militaries seeking insights that could offer an edge in future conflicts. A Chinese-made Pakistani fighter plane shot down at least two Indian military aircraft on Wednesday, two US officials told Reuters , marking a potential major milestone for Beijing's advanced fighter jet. The aerial clash is a rare opportunity for militaries to study the performance of pilots, fighter jets and air-to-air missiles in active combat, and use that knowledge to prepare their own air forces for battle. Experts said the live use of advanced weapons would be analysed across the world, including in China and the United States which are both preparing for a potential conflict over Taiwan or in the wider Indo-Pacific region. One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters there was high confidence that Pakistan had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets. Social media posts focused on the performance of China's PL-15 air-to-air missile against the Meteor, a radar-guided air-to-air missile produced by the European group MBDA. There has been no official confirmation these weapons were used. ""Air warfare communities in China, the US and a number of European countries will be extremely interested to try and get as much ground truth as they can on tactics, techniques, procedures, what kit was used, what worked and what didn't,"" said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. ""You have arguably China's most capable weapon against the West's most capable weapon, if indeed it was being carried; we don't know that,"" Barrie said. The French and Americans would likely be hoping for similar intelligence from India, Barrie said. ""The PL-15 is a big problem. It is something that the US military pays a lot of attention to,"" a defence industry executive said. Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation declined comment and the MBDA consortium could not immediately be reached for comment on a French public holiday. Western analysts and industry sources said crucial details remained unclear, including whether the Meteor was carried and the type and amount of training the pilots had received. Arms firms would also be anxious to separate technical performance from operational factors, analysts said. ""There will be audits of what works and what doesn't work, but I think the other overlay is the proverbial fog of war,"" said Byron Callan, a Washington-based defence expert and managing partner of Capital Alpha Partners. US arms companies are getting constant feedback about how their products are working in the war in Ukraine, he said. ""So I absolutely expect the same to be the case with India's European suppliers, and Pakistan and China are probably sharing the same feedback. If the PL-15 is working as advertised or better than expected, the Chinese would like to hear that."" A defence industry source from a Western country operating the Meteor said an online picture of a seeker appeared to feature the component of a missile that had missed its target. There are conflicting reports on whether Pakistan has the domestic version of the PL-15 from the PLAAF, China's air force, or the lower-range export version publicly unveiled in 2021. Barrie, who has written extensively on the missile, said he believed that Pakistan most likely has the export version. A Western industry source dismissed claims that the rocket-powered PL-15 had longer range than the air-breathing Meteor but acknowledged that its capability ""may be greater than was thought."" The Meteor's range has not been officially published. ""At the moment, it's not possible to judge anything. We know so little,"" the industry source said. The PL-15's range and performance have been a focus of Western interest for years. Its emergence was seen as one of many signals that China had moved well beyond reliance on Soviet-era derivative technology. The United States is developing the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile via Lockheed Martin partly in response to the PL-15 and its beyond-visual-range performance — part of a broader reset of Western priorities toward China. European nations are exploring a mid-life upgrade for Meteor, which specialist publication Janes says could involve propulsion and guidance, but analysts say progress has been slow. US President Donald Trump in March awarded Boeing the contract to build the US Air Force's most sophisticated fighter jet yet, which would likely include stealth, advanced sensors and cutting-edge engines."
"In his first appearance, Pope Leo offers three big clues about his papacy","May 09, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603748-in-his-first-appearance-pope-leo-offers-three-big-clues-about-his-papacy,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-09/603748_386888_updates.jpg,"From his first moments on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, Pope Leo XIV gave three important clues about what kind of leader of the 1.4-billion-member Catholic Church he will be. Leo, formerly United States Cardinal Robert Prevost, was elected by the world's cardinals on Thursday as the new pope on the second day of the conclave to choose a successor to Pope Francis, who died last month. He is the first pope from the US but holds dual citizenship in Peru, where he was a missionary for decades before becoming a cardinal. Leo's first clue was his choice of name. Popes often use this choice to send their first major signal about the priorities of their new papacy. Francis took his name from the 13th-century St Francis of Assisi, who rejected wealth and wanted to care for the poor. The last pope to take the name Leo, Leo XIII, focused much of his 1878-1903 papacy on advocating for the rights of workers, calling for fair pay, fair working conditions, and the right to join unions. ""By picking the name Leo XIV, he shows he is committed to the social teaching of the church,"" said Rev Thomas Reese, a Jesuit commentator who follows the papacy closely. ""La pace sia con tutti voi!"" (Peace be with you!), Leo's first words in public, echoed the ones Catholics use in their celebrations but also offered an immediate message of peace in a world riven with conflict. Before heading into the secret conclave on May 7, the world's cardinals issued a statement lamenting the conflicts ""in Ukraine, the Middle East, and many other parts of the world"" and making a ""heartfelt appeal"" for peace. The new pope said he wanted to share God's peace, calling it ""a disarmed peace and a disarming peace"" that is ""humble and persevering."" Leo also mentioned Francis, who offered his last blessing to crowds in Rome on Easter Sunday, the day before he died of a stroke after battling double pneumonia for weeks. ""We still have in our ears that weak, but always courageous voice of Pope Francis,"" he said. Leo asked permission to offer the same blessing Francis used just a few weeks ago, saying: ""God loves us, God loves everyone, and evil will not prevail. We are in the hands of God."" Leo's third clue was in his choice of attire. Unlike Francis, who spurned all the trappings of the papacy including on the first day he was elected in 2013, Leo wore a traditional red papal garment over his white cassock. Although Leo follows in the tradition of Francis, he signalled he is a new, and different, pope."

""80% Tariff on China seems right!"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, which would bring them down from 145%, with cumulative duties on some goods reaching a staggering 245%. He added that it was ""Up to Scott B."", referring to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who will confer with China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng this weekend in Geneva to try to cool the conflict roiling international markets. In his post, Trump did not say if he thought 80% should be the final, definitive level for tariffs on Chinese goods if and when the trade war ends, or an interim status. In another post, this time all in capital letters, Trump said ""China should open up its market to USA — would be so good for them!!! Closed markets don’t work anymore!!!"" Trump’s comments came a day after he unveiled what he called a historic trade agreement with Britain, the first deal with any country since he unleashed a blitz of sweeping global tariffs last month. Trump said the British deal would be the first of many, and that he hoped difficult talks with the EU — as well as China — could soon produce results too. Several countries have lined up to hold talks with Washington to avert the worst of Trump´s duties, which range from 10% for many countries to the sky high ones on China —Trump’s main target."
Fiction takes over reality: Indian media drowning in fake news,"May 09, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603813-fiction-takes-over-reality-indian-media-drowning-in-fake-news,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-09/603813_4725243_updates.jpg,"The ongoing hostilities between India and Pakistan aren't just restricted to the battlefield — a parallel war has been opened against Islamabad on Indian mainstream as well as social media. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the April 22 attack on tourists in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan — a claim Islamabad denies. On May 7, India launched unprovoked strikes in Pakistan, killing at least 31 civilians. Pakistan retaliated by downing five Indian fighter jets, including three Rafales, and nearly 80 drones. Despite this, India continued its aerial intrusions. On the night of May 9-10, it attacked three Pakistani airbases. In response, Pakistan launched a powerful strike targeting over 20 Indian military sites. But let’s take a quick look at how the war is unfolding on social media — and how fictitiously Indian media has covered the ongoing tensions. Meanwhile, following India's first attack, in a state of panic, several prominent Indian news networks unleashed a coordinated barrage of false claims, fueling nationalist hysteria and manufacturing a fictional narrative of overwhelming Indian victories and Pakistani collapse. Indian media claimed that India shot down two Pakistani fighter jets and captured one of its pilots. Some news outlets also accused Pakistan of launching attacks on Pathankot, Jaisalmer, and Srinagar. However, the government of Pakistan categorically rejected the baseless and irresponsible allegations propagated by the Indian media, saying: ""These claims are entirely unfounded, politically motivated, and part of a reckless propaganda campaign aimed at maligning Pakistan."" The channel DNA, for example, posted a bombastic update on its official X account proclaiming: “India attacks Pakistani Capital Islamabad!” The post was later quietly deleted without explanation. Zee News took the falsehood a step further, asserting that Pakistan’s capital had been “occupied” by Indian forces. Meanwhile, Aaj Tak staged a dramatic simulation of a military strike on Karachi Port, presenting it as a real-time offensive. India Today followed suit, claiming attacks on both Lahore and Karachi. Zee News went further still, airing graphics declaring that the Pakistani military had surrendered and several major cities had fallen to Indian control. The segment simultaneously portrayed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as hiding in a bunker while also surrendering — both images aired within moments of each other. Anchors Anjana Om Kashyap and Shweta Singh, from Aaj Tak , joined the disinformation campaign with alarming reports of alleged suicide bombings in Pathankot and Rajouri — both of which remain completely fictional. The fabricated reports were so excessive and absurd that they sparked backlash from within India itself. Notably, Indian commentator and author Basant Maheshwari publicly apologised for sharing unverified news: ""I have NEVER deleted tweets but today I am deleting all tweets that I made without verifying the claims of our Indian media channels. I feel sad not because of tweeting but more so because I [wrongly] believed what I saw!"" Indian fact-checker Mohammed Zubair also highlighted the hysteria in Indian media, which fuelled public unrest. Times Now , he said, shared an unverified video with a baseless claim that explosions were heard near Jaipur airport creating panic among citizens. However, it deleted it later. ""No clarification."" Apart from Aaj Tak, veteran journalist Barkha Dutt also shared that Indian forces had targeted Karachi Port, showing how deeply fake news had affected even journalists known for their credibility. ""BREAKING @themojostory - our Navy has targeted the Karachi Port - as part of the massive ongoing retaliation in response to Pakistan missiles and drones targeted at multiple locations in India including Jammu airport, more details awaited."" Taking things forward, Times Now also reported that a coup was taking place against Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir — at at time when all political parties as well as citizens have stood behind the armed forces. India also labelled its own citizen, Qari Mohammad Iqbal, a “most-wanted terrorist”, who was killed on May 7. ""Conferred with the title Qari, someone who reads and recites the Quran, he was dubbed a terrorist by mainstream media outlets,"" reported Alt News . However, later, Poonch district police refuted such claims, saying: ""The deceased, Maulana Mohd Iqbal, was a respected religious figure in the local community and had no affiliation with any terror outfit."" Meanwhile, videos were also shared, which were purported to be from Karachi. A huge explosion was seen in that video as well as a screengrab from the viral clip. ABP Ananda’s official X account with a caption that said: “BIG BREAKING: Major action by INS Vikrant, massive explosion, Karachi devastated, consecutive attacks by India”. However, when they might have figured out that they were wrong, they edited the X post and replaced the screengrab with an image of a Pakistani flag. Republic , another Indian news channel, reported that a blast occurred near the Pakistani Prime Minister House. But did it stop there? No. It went ahead and said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had been moved to a safehouse. Also, if you're wondering, the blast actually did not take place."

US President Donald Trump, who withdrew Washington from a 2015 deal between Tehran and world powers meant to curb its nuclear activity, has threatened to bomb Iran if no new deal is reached to resolve the long-standing dispute. Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, plans to attend the talks in Oman, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. Western countries say Iran's nuclear programme, which Tehran accelerated after the US walkout from the now moribund 2015 accord, is geared toward producing weapons, whereas Iran insists it is purely for civilian purposes. ""The negotiations are moving forward, and naturally, the further we go, the more consultations and reviews are needed,"" Araqchi said in remarks carried by Iranian state media. ""The delegations require more time to examine the issues that are raised. But what is important is that we are on a forward-moving path and gradually entering into the details."" Witkoff, in an interview with Breitbart News, said the Iranians had stated that they do not want a nuclear weapon and the United States will ""take them at their word"" on this point. ""If that’s how they feel, then their enrichment facilities have to be dismantled. They cannot have centrifuges. They have to downblend all of their fuel that they have there and send it to a faraway place — and they have to convert to a civil programme if they want to run a civil programme,"" he said. The fourth round of indirect negotiations, initially scheduled for May 3 in Rome, was postponed, with mediator Oman citing ""logistical reasons"". In a separate statement on Friday, Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi said that after ""coordination with both Iran and the US"", the fourth round of negotiations was set to take place on Sunday in Muscat. Araqchi said his planned visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia on Saturday was in line with ""continuous consultations"" with neighbouring countries to ""address their concerns and mutual interests"" about the nuclear issue."

The flood of fabrications prompted rare introspection from a few influential voices. Indian author Basant Maheshwari, who commands a large online following, issued a public apology: “I have NEVER deleted tweets but today I am deleting all tweets that I made without verifying the claims of our Indian media channels. I feel sad not because of tweeting but more so because I (wrongly) believed what I saw!” Let’s have a glance on some of the most hilarious lies and false claims broadcast on Indian mainstream media channels on Thursday. On Thursday, Indian channel DNA went so far as to post on its official X handle: “India attacks Pakistani Capital Islamabad!” The post was later deleted without explanation. A little while later, Zee News amplified claimed that “Pakistan’s Capital Islamabad has been occupied!” The frenzy didn’t stop when Aaj Tak simulated a military strike on Karachi Port, broadcasting the fabricated destruction live from its studio as if covering a real-time offensive. India Today joined in by alleging an Indian assault on both Lahore and Karachi. Times Now Bharat took it a step further with theatrical newsroom histrionics, even enlisting a retired Indian serviceman to legitimise the charade. “The performance was so exaggerated that it drew both public ridicule and concern,” stated an international news agency. Among the most egregious fabrications was a report from ABP News , falsely claiming that Pakistani Army Chief General Asim Munir had been arrested. The disinformation reached absurd levels when Zee News aired graphics declaring that the Pakistan Army had surrendered after Indian forces “captured several major cities.” Screens simultaneously showed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hiding in a bunker and surrendering to Indian forces within the same segment.

The statement came after Pakistan fired Al-Fatah missiles in retaliation for India's Operation Sindoor, in which it targeted over 20 Indian military sites across multiple regions, senior security officials confirmed to Geo News earlier today. “Pakistani military (used) UCAV, drones, long-range weapons, loitering munitions and fighter aircrafts to target civilian areas and military infrastructure,” Indian Air Force officer Vyomika Singh claimed at a news conference in New Delhi with Vikram Misri, the foreign secretary. “There were also several high-speed missile attacks noticed subsequently (during) night at several air bases in Punjab,” Turkish news agency, Anadolu , quoted Singh as saying. ""Limited damage was sustained to equipment and personnel at Indian Air Force stations at Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj,"" claimed Indian Air Force officer Singh. Following Indian missile attack in Pakistan targeting airbases, the Pakistan Air Force, using its JF-17 thunder jets, destroyed India’s S-400 air defence system in Adampur by using hypersonic missiles, besides targeting several others key military sites. US President Donald Trump said today that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a fourth day of strikes and counter-strikes against each other's military installations. ""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Pakistan's foreign minister also said both countries had agreed to a ceasefire ""with immediate effect"" and India's foreign ministry said it would start at 5pm Indian time (1130 GMT). The sudden announcement came on a day when fears spiked that the countries' nuclear arsenals might come into play as Pakistan's military said a top military and civilian body overseeing its nuclear weapons would meet. But Pakistan's defence minister later said no such meeting was scheduled. India's foreign ministry said that the head of Pakistan's military operations called his Indian counterpart on Saturday afternoon and it was agreed that both sides would stop all firing. The two heads will speak to each other again on May 12, the ministry added. The fighting began on Wednesday when India carried out strikes on what it said was ""terrorist infrastructure"" in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Pakistan, two weeks after 26 people were killed in an attack on tourists in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). Pakistan denied India's accusations that it was involved in the tourist attack. Since Wednesday, the two countries have exchanged cross-border fire and shelling, and sent drones and missiles into each other's airspace. The countries have been locked in a dispute over Kashmir since they were born after the end of British colonial rule in 1947. They have gone to war three times since, including twice over Kashmir, and clashed several times."

""If the goal of the negotiations is to deprive Iran of its nuclear rights, I state clearly that Iran will not back down from any of its rights,"" state media quoted Araqchi as saying. Iran has repeatedly said its right to enrich uranium is non-negotiable and has ruled out a ""zero enrichment"" demand by some US officials.

According to American media, top officials in the Trump administration — including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles — were actively monitoring the crisis. On Friday morning, the US reportedly received “alarming intelligence” about the potential for dramatic escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours. While officials refrained from disclosing the specifics of the intelligence due to its sensitivity, they confirmed it played a pivotal role in prompting the US to intensify its diplomatic engagement, the publication reported. VP Vance, after briefing President Donald Trump, called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, as per the report. ""During the call, Vance conveyed Washington’s deep concerns over a high probability of further escalation and urged India to open direct channels of communication with Pakistan, according to the officials,"" it added. At that time, US officials believed that there was no active communication between New Delhi and Islamabad, and Vance reportedly outlined a potential de-escalation pathway that, according to US understanding, Pakistan was willing to consider. Following the call, State Department officials, including Rubio, began working the phones with their counterparts in India and Pakistan through the night, the CNN report added. The Trump administration was not involved in helping draft the agreement, the administration officials said, and viewed their role mostly as getting the two sides together to talk. But from the US perspective, Vance’s call to Modi was a critical moment. Pakistan and India agreed Saturday to a full and immediate ceasefire after days of deadly jet fighter, missile, drone and artillery attacks — news surprisingly announced by US President Donald Trump, who congratulated them on using ""common sense"". Officials from Islamabad and New Delhi confirmed the development minutes after Trump posted the announcement on his Truth Social network, as the conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours appeared to be spiralling towards a full-blown war. ""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.

According to the United Nations, up to 1,400 protesters died in July 2024 when Hasina's government launched a brutal campaign to silence the opposition. Hasina remains in self-imposed exile in India and has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity. ""It has been decided to ban the activities — including in cyberspace — of the Awami League under the Anti-Terrorism Act until the trial of the Awami League and its leaders ends,"" Asif Nazrul, a government advisor on law and justice, told reporters. Bangladesh's interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has led an interim government since Hasina was overthrown. Nazrul said the decision was taken to ensure the country's ""sovereignty and security"" and ""the security of the protesters"" along with safeguarding ""the plaintiffs and the witnesses of the tribunal."" Yunus's administration also simultaneously approved an amendment to the country's International Crimes Tribunal Act, allowing authorities to prosecute political parties and their affiliated bodies. The Awami League rejected the administration's move, calling it ""illegitimate."" The ban comes a day after thousands of people rallied outside Yunus's residence, demanding a ban on Hasina's party. On Thursday, former Awami League leader Abdul Hamid — also under investigation — successfully left the country. At least three police officers responsible for overseeing airport arrivals and departures have been dismissed for negligence in the wake of Hamid's departure, officials said."

The closed-door discussions, held at the Swiss ambassador’s residence, come as both sides signal a cautious willingness to de-escalate one of the most severe trade stand-offs in recent years. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng for the first such negotiations between the world’s two largest economies since Trump slapped steep new levies on China last month, sparking robust retaliation from Beijing. The discussions are expected to restart on Sunday in the Swiss city, according to an individual familiar with the talks, who was not authorised to speak publicly. ""The contact in Switzerland is an important step in promoting the resolution of the issue,"" a commentary published by China’s state news agency Xinhua said. It provided no further details on the progress of closed-door discussions, which began mid-morning Saturday. The negotiations took place at the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, a discreet villa with sky blue shutters near a large park on the left bank of Lake Geneva. Tariffs imposed by Trump on the Asian manufacturing giant since the start of the year currently total 145 percent, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245 percent. In retaliation, China slapped 125 percent levies on US goods, cementing what appears to be a near trade embargo between the two countries. Trump signalled Friday that he might lower the sky-high tariffs on Chinese imports, taking to social media to suggest that an ""80% Tariff on China seems right!"". ""The president would like to work it out with China,"" US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News on Friday. ""He would like to de-escalate the situation."" Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally, and that China would need to make concessions. In any case, a move to that level would be a symbolic gesture, since the tariffs would remain prohibitively steep. ""The relationship is not good"" between Washington and Beijing, said Bill Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. ""We have trade-prohibitive tariffs going in both directions. Relations are deteriorating,"" said Reinsch, a longtime former member of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a bipartisan committee that advises Congress. ""But the meeting is a good sign."" ""I think this is basically to show that both sides are talking — and that itself is very important,"" said Xu Bin, professor of economics and finance at the China Europe International Business School. ""Because China is the only country that has tit-for-tat tariffs against Trump’s tariffs,"" he told AFP. Bessent has said the meetings in Switzerland would focus on ""de-escalation"" and not a ""big trade deal"". Beijing has insisted the United States must lift tariffs first and vowed to defend its interests. ""Trade wars and tariff battles yield no winners,"" said a commentary piece run by Xinhua early Sunday. China’s vice premier went into the discussions buoyed by news on Friday that China’s exports rose last month despite the trade war. The unexpected development was attributed by experts to a re-routing of trade to Southeast Asia to mitigate US tariffs. Bessent and He were meeting two days after Trump unveiled a trade agreement with Britain, the first deal with any country since he unleashed his blitz of sweeping global tariffs. The five-page, non-binding deal with London confirmed to nervous investors that the United States is willing to negotiate sector-specific relief from recent duties — in this case, on British cars, steel and aluminium. In return, Britain agreed to open up its markets to US beef and other farm products. But a 10 percent baseline levy on most British goods remained intact and Trump remains ""committed"" to keeping it in place for other countries, Leavitt told reporters on Friday. A few hours later, Trump appeared to contradict her, suggesting there could be some flexibility to the baseline — but only if the right deals could be reached. ""There could be an exception at some point. We’ll see,"" he said. ""If somebody did something exceptional for us, that’s always possible."""
Putin calls for direct Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul on May 15,"May 11, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/604002-putin-calls-for-direct-ukraine-peace-talks-in-istanbul-on-may-15,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-11/604002_388842_updates.jpg,"MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for direct peace talks with Ukraine to be held in Istanbul on 15 May. He said the talks should focus on ending the war and dealing with the reasons it began. The Russian leader sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, starting the most serious clash between Russia and the West since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. He said that Russia was proposing direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul in an attempt to ‘eliminate the root causes of the conflict’ and ‘to achieve the restoration of a long-term, lasting peace.’ Putin blamed Ukraine for walking away from talks in 2022, but said Moscow is now ready to resume discussions without any conditions. ‘It was not Russia that broke off negotiations in 2022. It was Kyiv. Nevertheless, we are proposing that Kyiv resume direct negotiations without any preconditions,’ Putin said, referring to failed talks shortly after the Russian invasion of 2022. ‘We offer the Kyiv authorities to resume negotiations already on Thursday, in Istanbul,’ Putin said. ‘Our proposal, as they say, is on the table. The decision is now up to the Ukrainian authorities and their curators, who are guided, it seems, by their personal political ambitions, and not by the interests of their peoples.’ Major European powers threw their weight behind an unconditional 30-day Ukraine ceasefire on Saturday, with the backing of US President Donald Trump, and threatened Putin with ‘massive’ new sanctions if he did not accept within days. Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker, has repeatedly said he wants to end the ‘bloodbath’ of the Ukraine war, which his administration casts as a proxy war between the United States and Russia. Former US President Joe Biden, Western European leaders, and Ukraine cast the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and have repeatedly vowed to defeat Russian forces. Putin casts the war as a watershed moment in Moscow’s relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine."
Trump hails US-China trade ‘reset' after first day of talks,"May 11, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/604005-trump-hails-us-china-trade-reset-after-first-day-of-talks,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-11/604005_1310444_updates.jpg,"US President Donald Trump hailed early Sunday a ""total reset"" in US-China trade relations following the first day of talks between top American and Chinese officials in Geneva aimed at de-escalating tensions sparked by his aggressive tariff rollout, AFP reported. Trump praised the ""very good"" discussions and deemed them ""a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner."" ""We want to see, for the good of both China and the US, an opening up of China to American business,"" he said in a Truth Social post Saturday evening in Washington. He added: ""GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!"" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met Saturday with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng for the first such negotiations between the world’s two largest economies since Trump slapped steep new levies on China last month, sparking robust retaliation from Beijing. The discussions are expected to continue Sunday in Geneva, according to an individual familiar with the talks, who was not authorised to speak publicly. ""The contact in Switzerland is an important step in promoting the resolution of the issue,"" a commentary published by China’s state news agency Xinhua said. The closed-door negotiations took place at the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, a discreet villa with sky blue shutters near a large park on the left bank of Lake Geneva. Tariffs imposed by Trump on China since the start of the year currently total 145 percent, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245 percent. In retaliation, China slapped 125 percent levies on US goods, cementing what appears to be a near trade embargo between the two countries. Trump signalled Friday that he might lower the sky-high tariffs on Chinese imports, taking to social media to suggest that an ""80% Tariff on China seems right!"". ""The president would like to work it out with China,"" US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News on Friday. ""He would like to de-escalate the situation."" Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally and that China would need to make concessions. In any case, a move to that level would be a symbolic gesture, since the tariffs would remain prohibitively steep. Bessent has said the meetings in Switzerland would focus on ""de-escalation"" and not a ""big trade deal"". Beijing has insisted that the United States must lift tariffs first and vowed to defend its interests. ""Trade wars and tariff battles yield no winners,"" said a commentary piece run by Xinhua early Sunday. China’s vice premier went into the discussions buoyed by news on Friday that China’s exports rose last month despite the trade war. The unexpected development was attributed by experts to a re-routing of trade to Southeast Asia to mitigate US tariffs. Bessent and He were meeting two days after Trump unveiled a trade agreement with Britain, the first deal with any country since he unleashed his blitz of sweeping global tariffs. The five-page, non-binding deal with London confirmed to nervous investors that the United States is willing to negotiate sector-specific relief from recent duties -- in this case, on British cars, steel and aluminium. In return, Britain agreed to open up its markets to US beef and other farm products. But a 10 percent baseline levy on most British goods remained intact and Trump remains ""committed"" to keeping it in place for other countries, Leavitt told reporters on Friday. A few hours later, Trump appeared to contradict her, suggesting there could be some flexibility to the baseline -- but only if the right deals could be reached. ""There could be an exception at some point. We’ll see,"" he said. ""If somebody did something exceptional for us, that’s always possible."""
"Iran, US to resume nuclear talks amid clashing red lines","May 11, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/604019-iran-us-to-resume-nuclear-talks-amid-clashing-red-lines,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-11/604019_9028608_updates.jpg,"DUBAI: Top Iranian and US negotiators will resume talks on Sunday to address disputes over Tehran's nuclear programme, in a push for progress as Washington hardens its stance ahead of US President Donald Trump's Middle East visit. Though Tehran and Washington both have said they prefer diplomacy to resolve the decades-long dispute, they remain deeply divided on several red lines that negotiators will have to circumvent to reach a new nuclear deal and avert future military action. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will hold the fourth round of talks in Muscat through Omani mediators, despite Washington taking a tough stance in public that Iranian officials said would not help the negotiations. Witkoff told Breitbart News on Thursday that Washington's red line is: ""No enrichment. That means dismantlement, no weaponisation,” requiring the complete dismantling of Iran’s nuclear facilities in Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan. ""If they are not productive on Sunday, then they won't continue and we'll have to take a different route,” Witkoff said in the interview. Trump, who has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails, will travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on May 13-16. Reacting to Witkoff's comments, Araqchi said on Saturday that Iran would not compromise on its nuclear rights. ""Iran continues negotiations in good faith... if the aim of these talks is to limit Iran’s nuclear rights, I state clearly that Iran will not back down from any of its rights,"" Araqchi said. Tehran is willing to negotiate some curbs on its nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions, according to Iranian officials, but ending its enrichment programme or surrendering its enriched uranium stockpile are among ""Iran's red lines that could not be compromised"" in the talks. A senior Iranian official close to the negotiating team said that US demands for ""zero enrichment and dismantling Iran's nuclear sites would not help in progressing the negotiations"". ""What the US says publicly differs from what is said in negotiations,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. He said matters would become clearer when talks take place on Sunday, which was initially planned for May 3 in Rome but were postponed due to what Oman described as ""logistical reasons"". Moreover, Iran has flatly ruled out negotiating its ballistic missile programme and the clerical establishment demands watertight guarantees Trump would not again ditch a nuclear pact. Trump, who has restored a ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Tehran since February, exited Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers in 2018 during his first term and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran. Iran, which has long said its nuclear programme is peaceful, has breached the 2015 pact's nuclear curbs since 2019 including ""dramatically"" accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons-grade, according to the UN nuclear watchdog."

Among the worst road accidents in the country in decades, the state-owned bus was travelling through the central hilly region of Kotmale when the driver lost control and it veered off a cliffside road before dawn, police said. It was carrying around 70 passengers — about 20 more than its capacity — police said, adding that an investigation was underway. ""We are trying to establish whether it was a mechanical failure or if the driver fell asleep at the wheel,"" a local police official told AFP by telephone. ""Fifteen people have died and we have sent 30 to hospital,"" who were mostly Buddhists, added the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to media. The bus was travelling from the pilgrim town of Kataragama in the island's deep south to the central city of Kurunegala, a distance of about 250 kilometres (155 miles). Sri Lanka records an average of 3,000 road fatalities annually, making the island's roads among the most dangerous in the world. Sunday's bus accident was one of the worst in Sri Lanka since April 2005, when a driver attempted to beat a train at a level crossing in the town of Polgahawela. The bus driver escaped with minor injuries, but 37 passengers were killed. In March 2021, 13 passengers and the driver of a privately owned bus died when the vehicle crashed into a precipice in Passara, about 100 kilometres east of the scene of the accident on Sunday."
"Nuclear neighbours, economic fallout: The economic cost of the Pakistan-India war","May 07, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/604021-nuclear-neighbours-economic-fallout-the-economic-cost-of-the-pakistan-india-war,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-07/604021_6628879_updates.jpg,"A dangerous and fast-escalating game of economic brinkmanship is gripping South Asia, as nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan may lurch towards a prolonged standoff with potentially far-reaching consequences. What began as a diplomatic rift in the wake of the tragic Pahalgam attack has rapidly spiralled into a high-stakes confrontation, marked by retaliatory airspace closures, the threat of a water blockade, and growing disruption to cross-border trade and supply chains. India’s threat to suspend Pakistan’s access to shared water resources — a move that challenges the sanctity of the Indus Waters Treaty — has stoked fears of an unprecedented environmental and agricultural crisis downstream. Meanwhile, the closure of airspace by both nations has rerouted major commercial aviation corridors, raising costs, delaying cargo, and threatening a domino effect across the region’s logistics and travel sectors. As both countries harden their positions, experts warn that the economic cost is already mounting, with critical sectors such as aviation, trade, agriculture, and foreign investment taking the first hits. The situation is compounded by the fragility of investor sentiment, as financial markets in both countries react with anxiety to the spectre of prolonged instability. With the world watching closely and calls for de-escalation growing louder, South Asia finds itself once again on the edge, not just of conflict, but of an economic fallout with global reverberations. The closure of Pakistani airspace to Indian airlines on April 24 has already translated into staggering losses for Indian carriers. “The closure of Pakistani airspace to Indian airlines since April 24, 2025, has caused immediate economic losses estimated at around $800 million annually for Indian carriers,” said Dr Khaqan Najeeb, former adviser to the Ministry of Finance. Flights have been rerouted over the Arabian Sea or forced to make refuelling stops in Europe, increasing journey times by two to 4.5 hours. This has raised fuel and crew costs, reduced cargo capacity, and triggered a spike in fares for Indian passengers — outcomes that could dent demand and hit India’s travel and tourism sector hard. “The closure also benefits non-Indian carriers, potentially shifting market share away from Indian airlines,” Dr Najeeb added. For Pakistan, however, the economic losses are minimal. “With only small losses in civil aviation fees and limited flights to the east, PIA is expected to face minimal impact,” he noted. “Thus, Pakistan’s airspace closure imposes significant economic costs on Indian airlines through higher expenses, disrupted routes, and competitive disadvantages, while Pakistan faces negligible losses.” The ripple effects of suspended routes have been felt across air cargo transport as well, disrupting supply chains and increasing freight costs for regional businesses. While Pakistani airspace has since reopened, some experts caution this could only be a reprieve.  “Closure of airspace does have a financial impact… but airspace has been opened now. And it indicates that any closure, even in future, will be of short duration,” observed Muhammad Faisal, South Asia security researcher at the University of Technology Sydney. The bilateral trade relationship between India and Pakistan had already been minimal, but the closure of land borders and air routes is compounding logistical challenges. “India's exports to Pakistan are estimated at approximately $1.2 billion on an annual basis, consisting mainly of pharmaceutical, organic chemicals… the suspension of trade will halt these exports, resulting in an immediate revenue loss for Indian exporters,” Dr Najeeb noted. By contrast, Pakistan’s exports to India are negligible — just $0.42 million annually — softening the blow for Islamabad. “Products imported by Pakistan from India are not unique… these products can be sourced relatively quickly from other countries,” he added. However, the disruption extends beyond bilateral flows. India’s trade with Afghanistan — including agricultural imports worth $640 million — depends largely on land routes passing through Pakistan. The recent closure has frozen this corridor, affecting Indian markets reliant on Afghan produce and halting Indian exports to Afghanistan valued at over $300 million. “Tensions are causing substantial disruptions to trade routes and having a negative impact on businesses in the region,” Dr Najeeb warned. “This instability slows economic growth, limits job creation, and hampers development, affecting not only both countries but also their neighbours.” “Though no immediate impact of tensions is anticipated on the credit ratings of both countries, de-escalation can limit lasting negative effects on sovereign creditworthiness.” Economist Ammar Habib downplayed the near-term trade impact, pointing out that Pakistan has not been trading directly with India on any sizeable scale for more than five years now, so the impact would be negligible.” He added: “Air corridors typically reopen once aerial strikes subside.” India’s veiled threat to unilaterally suspend Pakistan’s access to its share of river waters under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) has sparked alarm in Islamabad and beyond. “International law and established norms protect the rights of lower riparian countries… the treaty explicitly forbids unilateral actions that would harm the other party’s water rights,” Dr Najeeb stressed. He called any such move a “violation of Pakistan’s legitimate rights as the lower riparian state.” Faisal said that the water threat posed a more serious medium-to-long-term risk. “On economic impact of water threat… impact will be limited [in the] near-term, but over medium-to-long run it will have significant economic impact, and Pakistan needs to prepare now for dealing with such eventuality.” The escalating situation has also rattled financial markets. “Across the board, all sectors saw a decline,” shared Sana Tawfiq, Head of Research at Arif Habib Limited. “In leasing sector, it was 7.3%; in refineries, 7.1%; in engineering, 6.4%; in technology, 5.9%.” However, she noted that global investors have not shown significant panic — neither Eurobond yields nor credit ratings have reacted dramatically. “In leasing sector, it was 7.3%; in refineries, 7.1%; in engineering, 6.4%; in technology, 5.9%."" However, she noted that global investors have not shown significant panic — neither Eurobond yields nor credit ratings have reacted dramatically. “Despite the heightened geopolitical risks, the rating Moody’s gave Pakistan remained B3… so that, in a way, was a positive thing,” she added. Referring to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) continued support to Ukraine during wartime, she pointed out: “The tranche will also hopefully be released as Pakistan has secured the IMF executive board's nod recently. So that concern stands addressed too, for those saying it won’t happen.” Despite the charged atmosphere, there are efforts underway to defuse tensions through diplomacy. “Pakistani authorities have confirmed that National Security Advisors and Directors General of Military Operations have made contact,” said Dr Najeeb, highlighting that backchannel negotiations and economic diplomacy remain critical. “Pakistan has actively engaged diplomatically, especially at the United Nations… and called for an international investigation [into the Pahalgam attack],” the economist emphasised. “It is most important to realise that our authorities have acted with restraint, maturity, and measured self-defence.” “Backchannel negotiations and economic diplomacy remain vital tools for de-escalation, managing crises, and laying the groundwork for eventual dialogue. “International mediation and coordinated pressure from key stakeholders can create space for these discreet engagements, especially persuading Indian authorities, who have launched air and drone strikes on Pakistan under a presumptuous pretext, without a shred of evidence linking it to the tragic incident,” Dr Najeeb added. Faisal noted that international mediation is unlikely, though “international community is most likely to continue to call on both sides to de-escalate and urge direct talks.” He also tied the escalation to broader strategic shifts: “It is demonstration of widening gap of national power between India and Pakistan… New Delhi feels emboldened to expand its regional influence.” “Pakistan, despite facing economic challenges, has the military potential to maintain strategic equilibrium with India.” Veteran journalist and political analyst Mazhar Abbas cautioned against complacency. “War is expensive, war is dangerous, particularly between the two nuclear states… The next few days are important for both.” He added: “The world needs to play a role before it's too late.” In the midst of rising tensions, Pakistan is pushing ahead with efforts to attract foreign investment. Khurram Schehzad, adviser to the finance minister, said: “Despite the conflict, we are continuing with the visit [to London] and meeting all the investors, officials, pitching Pakistan well… we have been getting solid feedback and interest to invest in Pakistan.” Amid spiralling rhetoric and disrupted corridors, Pakistan’s economic managers are prioritising stability. “Government will be focusing on national security first,” Habib stated bluntly. Meanwhile, Faisal underlined the importance of staying the course with the IMF programme: “Disbursal of IMF tranche to Pakistan will indicate to global markets that Pakistan is focused on economic stability despite tensions with India.” As the world watches closely, the question remains whether economic rationality and diplomatic backchannels can prevail over populist politics and military posturing. For now, the costs — in lost commerce, disrupted connectivity, and regional anxiety— continue to climb."

According to a statement issued by the Council, the decision has been made in coordination with the relevant examination boards to ensure the safety and security of all candidates. “This decision has been made to prioritise the safety & security of candidates,” the Council said, urging students and parents to rely solely on official British Council platforms for the latest updates. Candidates have been advised to remain in contact with their schools for further guidance. Private candidates have been asked to reach out to the British Council’s Customer Services centre for assistance. The statement did not mention whether the exams would be rescheduled but emphasised that all further announcements would be made through official channels. The development comes after India launched unprovoked strikes in Pakistan in the early hours of Wednesday, two weeks after it accused its neighbour of involvement in an attack in occupied Kashmir in which 26 people were killed. Islamabad had denied the accusation and vowed to retaliate to the missile strikes, also saying it shot down five Indian aircraft, 25 drones, and damaging multiple checkposts. As the tensions continue, authorities across the country are on high alert, with flights also being suspended intermittently."

Addressing a press conference on Thursday morning, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director-General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that the downed Indian aircraft included sophisticated 'Harop drones"", a loitering munition system developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). The army's top spokesperson also displayed a series of pictures during the press briefing that showed debris from the drones. The locations where the drones were intercepted include Karachi and Lahore, indicating a significant depth of the incursion. However, he assured the nation that the armed forces were on high alert and actively engaged in neutralising further threats. According to the IAI website, the Harop drone is a dual-capacity system that can both hover over a battlefield and strike targets upon command. It is particularly noted for its ability to target enemy air defences and other critical assets. This type of drone blurs the lines between a traditional unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a missile, possessing self-propelled flight capabilities and the option for autonomous or manual operations. If a target is not engaged, the Harop can return to base and land. Its design allows for launch from land-based canisters or air platforms. The Harop drone has a documented history of use in conflicts, notably by Azerbaijan against Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in both 2016 and 2020. It was allegedly used in attacks that resulted in casualties and the destruction of military vehicles. Additionally, the drone has reportedly been deployed in the Syrian conflict, with claims of successful strikes against Syrian air defences and armed forces. There are also suggestions that Turkiye may have been an early adopter of the system."

In a statement, Punjab Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat confirmed that the decision applies to both public and private sector schools, colleges, and universities across the province. He clarified that this closure is temporary, and academic activities will resume as per routine on Monday, May 12. The directive has been issued to ensure the safety of students, teachers, and school staff during the current situation. It is pertinent to mention here that the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) postponed yesterday’s intermediate and matriculation exams. Earlier in the day, the Pakistan’s armed forces took down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones sent into the country by India since last night, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.

Islamabad said six Pakistani locations, from mosques to hydropower projects, were targeted. At least 31 civilians, including children, were martyred and 57 sustained injuries after India launched unprovoked and devious attack on Pakistan.

""Pakistan Armed forces have so far shot down 25 Harop drones using both soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons-based) systems,"" said a statement issued by the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday. Later in the day, DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said at least 29 Indian drones had been shot down so far, while three people were martyred in the latest attacks. It said that the escalation follows India’s cowardly assault on May 6 and May 7, ""which resulted in the destruction of five advanced aircraft, drones, multiple military posts, and reported casualties among Indian troops"". In a state of panic and confusion, the ISPR said, India resorted to deploying Israeli-made Harop drones for attacks on Pakistani territory. “These unprovoked attacks are a clear reflection of India’s desperation and frustration, as it continues to suffer significant losses along the Line of Control (LoC),"" it added. Debris of the downed Israeli drones is being recovered from various locations across Pakistan, the military’s media wing added. ""Pakistan Armed Forces are responding with full force, thwarting all hostile designs and delivering a decisive response to the enemy’s aggression,"" it concluded. India launched strikes on Pakistan and AJK early Wednesday morning — an assault that Islamabad called a ""blatant act of war"". Islamabad said six Pakistani locations, from mosques to hydropower projects, were targeted. At least 31 civilians, including children, were martyred and 57 sustained injuries after India launched an unprovoked and devious attack at six locations — Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir. In retaliation, the Pakistan armed forces shot down five Indian Air Force (IAF) jets, seven drones, destroyed a brigade headquarters and a number of checkposts along the Line of Control (LoC). Separately, the Pakistan armed forces shot down two Indian drones that violated its airspace near Sukkur and Rahim Yar Khan. Security sources told Geo News that both drones were detected on radar systems and were promptly locked and neutralised by Pakistan’s air defence units. “The drones were precisely targeted after confirming their hostile trajectory within Pakistani territory,” said a senior security official. The officials stated that both drones had crossed into Pakistan in a serious violation of its sovereignty. “These were not routine surveillance drones — they posed a potential threat and were treated as such,” one official added. Following the shootdowns, a thorough search operation was launched in the surrounding areas to recover debris and assess any potential secondary threats. Security officials said Pakistan’s defensive response was swift and measured, demonstrating the readiness and capability of its armed forces to respond to any act of aggression. Speaking at press briefing early today, Director General Inter Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that Pakistan’s armed forces had neutralised 12 drones sent by India since last night. He also stated that four army personnel were injured as one drone, besides those downed, managed to engage a military target partially. The ISPR DG detailed the locations where 12 of those drones sent by India were neutralised — Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur’s Miano, Umerkot’s Chhor and near Karachi in Sindh. “Other than these 12, one drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “Four men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to equipment has occurred,” he added. Recalling that the Indian army faced “destruction of five of their aircraft and suffering heavy casualties along the Line of Control and damage”, the DG ISPR said India has “apparently lost the plot”. “Rather than going on a path of rationality, it is further escalating in a highly charged environment to satisfy the hubristic mindset of the Indian government,” he said. “The international community can visibly see the path that India is treading through this extremely provocative military aggression in a region that is right now highly fragile and putting the security of the region and beyond at risk. “Pakistan armed forces remain fully vigilant to any type of threat,” he added. He said there should be no doubt that India is paying dearly — and will continue to pay dearly — for this naked aggression and reckless military adventurism."

Speaking on a motion in the National Assembly, he mentioned that the National Security Committee (NSC) had authorised the country's highly-prepared armed forces to respond at a time and place of their choosing. ""Forces have been given full authority to deliver an effective and strong response. Now, it is up to us to decide where this matter goes from here. “Our response will come, and it will come soon. It will be a powerful response, one that the world will remember."" The minister slammed India for cowardly attacking Pakistan under the cover of darkness, using its advanced Rafale jets. “India’s arrogance has been shattered, and while it thought it was invincible, it has now been humbled,” he said, adding, “Pakistan always unites as one powerful force in the face of such challenges.” Tarar saluted Pakistan’s forces, calling them heroes for bringing down Indian aircraft and defeating India's pride. He noted that India has now changed its strategy after failing to achieve its goals with high-tech weapons. “Despite India’s superior technology, resilient Pakistanis are standing united in the face of any challenge, and even the manufacturers of Rafale are questioning the effectiveness of their product.” He also pointed out that the shares of Rafale's manufacturer have dropped by 18%. Responding to India’s cowardly midnight strikes on the night between May 6 and 7, Pakistan asserted its air combat dominance by downing five IAF fighter jets — including three Rafales, marking the first-ever kills of the French-made warplane. A Su-30MKI and a MiG-29 Fulcrum were also among the downed Indian planes. CNN on Wednesday quoted a high-ranking French intelligence official as saying: “One Rafale fighter jet operated by the IAF (Indian Air Force) was downed by Pakistan, in what would mark the first time that one of the sophisticated French-made warplanes has been lost in combat.” He said the country's defence was in strong and safe hands and the armed forces are fully prepared. ""The entire nation stands with the armed forces of Pakistan to respond to the Indian aggression,"" the information minister said."

Furthermore, PM Shehbaz strongly condemned India’s missile and drone strikes that killed 31 innocent civilians, injured 57 others and damaged civilian infrastructure, according to a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office. India’s attacks had violated Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, while gravely jeopardising peace and stability in the South Asia region, he added. The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s firm resolve to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs. However, he said that the people of Pakistan were outraged by India’s unprovoked acts of war. He also appreciated President Trump’s concern over the current security situation in South Asia. Secretary Rubio noted that the U.S. was closely following the situation in South Asia as it was committed to promoting peace and stability in the region. To this end, he emphasised the need for both Pakistan and India to work closely to de-escalate the situation. Both sides agreed to remain in touch.

Pakistan-India: On the brink — but is there a way back?,"May 08, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603663-pakistan-india-on-the-brink-but-is-there-a-way-back,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-08/603663_5179833_updates.jpg,"KARACHI: Just after the young couple arrived at Al-Sayyed Shabistan, a quaint guesthouse in Taobat, on April 30, soldiers showed up, urging them to leave — war, they warned, could break out any moment. Yahya Shah, guest-house owner and head of Taobat’s hotel association, told IPS over the phone, “Tourist season just began, but for two weeks the village feels like a ghost town—everyone’s hit: shopkeepers, eateries, drivers.” Just 2km from the tense Line of Control (not a legally recognised international border, but a de facto border under control of the military on both sides between the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) — parts of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir — Taobat sits where India’s Kishenganga river crosses into Pakistan — reborn as the Neelum. Tensions spiked after a deadly April 22 attack in the IIOJK's Pahalgam by The Resistance Front, killing 26 people — 25 Indians and one Nepali. India blamed Pakistan for backing TRF, calling it a Lashkar-e-Taiba front. Pakistan denied involvement, urging an independent probe. Meanwhile, pressure mounted on the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to respond forcefully, as the attackers remained at large two weeks later. The question on everyone’s mind — including Michael Kugelman, a Washington, DC-based South Asia analyst — is, “How could such a horrific attack have been carried out on soft targets in one of the most heavily militarised regions in the world?” On May 7, early morning, the intensity of the animosity between the two since the Pahalgam attack took on a serious turn when India launched a full-fledged series of attacks on Pakistan and AJK. India claimed it targeted “terrorist camps” in Pakistan, stating, “No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted.” Pakistan’s armed forces have been authorised to take “corresponding actions” following the strikes, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office said following the attack. The Indian attack killed 26 civilians, injuring 46. In addition, the Pakistani army reported downing five Indian jets. In retaliatory attacks by Pakistani forces, at least 10 people have been killed in IIOJK. Reuters , quoting the local government on the Indian side, admitted that three fighter jets crashed in IIOJK hours after India announced it had struck “nine Pakistani terrorist infrastructure sites across the border.” The international community has called for restraint, with the United States urging the two sides to “keep lines of communication open and avoid escalation” the United Kingdom offering “in dialogue, in de-escalation and anything we can do to support that, we are here and willing to do…” United Nations’ Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the international community could not “afford a military confrontation” between the nuclear-armed nations. Following the Pahalgam attack, India and Pakistan shut borders, halted visas, expelled visitors, and downgraded missions — familiar moves in past standoffs. But this time, India suspended the 1960 water treaty, prompting Pakistan to threaten withdrawal from the 1972 Simla Agreement. Dr Moonis Ahmar, former chairman of the department of international relations at Karachi University, blamed leaders of both countries for “misguiding their people” and polarising them by spewing so much vitriol. “What was the point of bringing in the unnecessary “jugular vein” conversation out of the blue? Recently, Pakistan’s army chief of staff, General Asim Munir’s characterisation of Kashmir as Pakistan’s jugular vein at a diaspora event held just days before the Pahalgam tragedy, was considered provocative and a “trigger” for the massacre. “But that is what it is, and the general only reiterated the stand taken by the Quaid,” defended Khawaja Muhammad Asif, the country’s defense minister, referring to the country’s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Defining the jugular vein, Asif said Kashmir stirred both deep emotions and economic concerns. Recalling the lesser-known massacre of the partition, he said, “Thousands of Muslims were massacred in the Jammu region by mobs and paramilitaries led by the army of Dogra ruler Hari Singh,” adding that Muslim villagers from Jammu province were forced to evacuate to West Pakistan and were then accommodated in refugee camps in the districts of Sialkot, Jhelum, Gujrat, and Rawalpindi. Asif, a native of Sialkot, emphasised that the economic significance of Kashmir cannot be overstated. “Kashmir is our lifeline—all our rivers, including the Jhelum, Sutlej, and even the smaller tributaries flowing through my own hometown, originate there,” he said, acknowledging that India’s recent announcement to withdraw from the pact posed a “real threat.” Over the years many historians from both sides have unraveled the historical, political, and emotional fault lines dividing India and Pakistan since 1947. But Kashmir remains the stumbling block, 78 years later. “At the time of British India’s partition in August 1947, the 565 princely states were given the option to join India, Pakistan, or remain independent— provided their people had the right to decide.” Jammu and Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state ruled by a Hindu king, Maharaja Hari Singh, initially chose to remain independent. After tribal militias from Pakistan invaded parts of Jammu and Kashmir in October 1947 — reportedly with covert support from Pakistani forces and encouragement from some local Muslims — the situation quickly descended into chaos and violence. Facing the threat, Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession, ceding the state’s sovereignty to India in exchange for military assistance. The Indian government, led by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, agreed to extend help but asked Hari Singh to sign an Instrument of Accession first. The Raja agreed. The documents conferred a special status on Jammu and Kashmir and allowed it to have its constitution, a flag, and control over internal administration, except in matters of defense, foreign affairs, finance, and communications, and were subsequently enshrined under Articles 370 and 35A of the Indian Constitution. “These rules were not just legal provisions; they were a vital protection that ensured that no non-resident could purchase immovable property in the region, and this was done to safeguard the distinct identity, local ownership, and indigenous rights of the Kashmiri people,” explained Naila Altaf Kayani, an expert in Kashmir affairs, speaking to IPS from Muzaffarabad in AJK. But even before 2019, especially between 1952 and 1986, and through 47 presidential orders, the historical guarantees under the Maharaja’s Instrument of Accession had slowly been diluted and J&K’s special status steadily diminished. “India effectively dismantled the State Subject Rules that had long been in place in Jammu and Kashmir,” said Kayani. In 2019, India finally scrapped these articles completely, and J&K became a union territory (governed directly by the central government, unlike states, which have their own elected governments with significant autonomy). Both Asif and Ahmar doubt the Kashmir dispute will be resolved in their lifetime. And till that doesn’t happen, the thorn in their side will keep pricking. But what the latter finds befuddling is the “unstable and unpredictable” Pakistan-India relationship. “The two countries swing between total silence and sudden warmth, with no steady, consistent engagement like most nations maintain,” he said. Ironically, it’s during the lowest points in their relationship that both Indian and Pakistani leaders stand to gain the most politically, said Kugelman. “Delhi can bolster its tough-on-terror stand and reputation as a strong and defiant administration by responding with muscle, and in Pakistan, the civilian and military leaderships, which are not terribly popular, can shore up public support by rallying the country around it in the face of an Indian threat.” Ahmar said this is the lowest point in India-Pakistan relations he has ever witnessed. However, “if by some miracle General Pervez Musharraf’s out-of-the-box four-point formula gets a shot in the arm,” perhaps we can begin anew, on a friendlier note,” he said, referring to the July 2001 Agra summit, hosted by Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee. The four fixes included a gradual demilitarisation of troops from both sides; no change in borders but allowing the people of Jammu and Kashmir to move freely across the LoC; self-governance without independence; and a joint supervision mechanism in the region involving India, Pakistan, and Kashmir. But until that happens, Ahmar said, it would be best to let the territory be put under international supervision until its fate is decided. “I would say, place the region under the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations for at least 10 years,” he said. Comprising the five permanent UN Security Council members — China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US — the Trusteeship Council aims to guide territories toward self-government or independence, either as separate states or by joining neighboring countries. The last trust territory, Palau, gained independence in October 1994. “The Trusteeship Council may have completed its mission in Palau but continues to exist on paper, under the UN Charter, chapter XII,” added Ahmar. Columnist Munazza Siddiqui, also executive producer at Geo News, advocated for yet another option: “Turn the LoC into a Working Boundary (a temporary, informally demarcated line used to separate areas, often in disputed regions or during a ceasefire, but different from the LoC, which is a military control line; something in-between the LoC and an international border), similar to the one that exists between Pakistan’s Punjab and IIOJK, as recognized under UN arrangements. “The idea is to then shift focus towards bilateral cooperation in other areas,” she pointed out, adding, “This approach can hopefully help de-escalate the violence historically associated with the Kashmir issue.” Zofeen Ebrahim is an independent journalist.

"Pakistan's strike will echo globally, no announcements would be needed: DG ISPR","May 08, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603690-pakistans-strike-will-echo-globally-no-announcements-would-be-needed-dg-ispr,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-08/603690_993412_updates.jpg,"Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Thursday warned that Pakistan’s retaliation to any Indian misadventure would be so decisive and resounding that the entire world would hear its echo, and no announcements would be needed. ""When Pakistan strikes, it will be unmistakable and undeniable. You won’t need the media to explain — the impact will speak for itself,” the military spokesperson said while addressing a joint press conference with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar. India launched strikes on Pakistan and AJK early Wednesday morning — an assault that Islamabad called a ""blatant act of war"". Islamabad said six Pakistani locations, from mosques to hydropower projects, were targeted. At least 31 civilians, including children, were martyred and 57 sustained injuries after India launched an unprovoked and devious attack at six locations — Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir. In retaliation, the Pakistan armed forces shot down five Indian Air Force (IAF) jets, seven drones, destroyed a brigade headquarters and a number of checkposts along the Line of Control (LoC). Later, New Delhi alleged that Pakistan targeted 15 Indian cities with drones and missiles. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Army said it shot down 29 drones from India at multiple locations, including Karachi and Lahore and the garrison city of Rawalpindi. During the press briefing today, the DG ISPR categorically dismissed India’s allegations that Pakistan launched attacks on 15 locations across Indian territory, labelling the claims as “utterly false.” He said India is trying to present fabricated evidence to justify its recent military actions against Pakistan. “India’s claims are baseless. The images they’ve shown of alleged Pakistani projectiles are laughable. A projectile of that nature would at least set dry grass on fire, but their so-called evidence shows no such damage,” the DG ISPR said. He said that India has claimed that Pakistan fired 15 projectiles, all of which were neutralised by Indian air defenses. However, the DG ISPR mocked these assertions, pointing out India’s failure to protect its own aircraft. “If India claims it neutralised 15 projectiles, why couldn’t it save its own five jets from being shot down by the Pakistan Air Force?” he asked, referring to downing five Indian aircraft, including three Rafale fighters, one MiG-29, and one SU-30 by the Pakistan Air Force. He said India, in the early hours of May 8, launched a highly provocative and dangerously escalatory attack on its own territory in Amritsar, calling it “a deeply insidious and sinister attack”. He said three projectiles were deliberately dropped off in the capital of Indian Punjab. The fourth projectile, he said, entered Pakistan airspace and was neutralised by Pakistan’s air defence. “Anything that is moving or anything that is coming, it is being monitored and being taken out.” He said Pakistan categorically denies any intention or action that would endanger the civilian population in Indian Punjab. ""Has the Indian army and government been living in the 18th century? When will they step out of the theatre and cinema and return to reality?” he asked. Speaking during the press conference, DPM Dar said that India deliberately targeted Amritsar with projectiles and missiles in a calculated move to incite anti-Pakistan sentiments within the Sikh community. “In a deeply sinister act, three projectiles were deliberately dropped at Amritsar, the capital of Indian Punjab while the fourth projectile which entered in Pakistan’s airspace was neutralised by Pakistan air defence and its debris fell in Denga which is inside Pakistan,” the deputy PM said. He added that this malicious act of the Hindutva regime falsely implicated Pakistan for targeting Indian civilians and inciting anti-Pakistani sentiments among the Punjabi Sikh population to externalise the rising communal tensions within India. “Pakistan categorically denies any intention or action that endangered civilian populations in Indian Punjab. Unlike the divisive policies of Indian leadership, Pakistan remains firmly committed to safeguarding innocent lives and regional harmony,” he added."

An Indian Air Force spokesperson said he had no comment when asked about the Reuters report. The performance of a leading Chinese fighter jet against a Western rival is being closely watched in Washington for insights into how Beijing might fare in any showdown over Taiwan or the wider Indo-Pacific. One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was high confidence that Pakistan had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets, bringing down at least two. Another official said that at least one Indian jet that was shot down was a French-made Rafale fighter aircraft. Both officials said Pakistan's F-16 aircraft, made by Lockheed Martin, were not used in the shootdown. New Delhi has not acknowledged the loss of any of its planes and instead said it carried out successful strikes inside Pakistan. World powers from the US to Russia and China have called for calm in one of the world's most dangerous, and most populated, nuclear flashpoint regions. In France, Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation and the MBDA consortium, which makes the Meteor air-to-air missile, could not immediately be reached for comment on a public holiday. While Reuters reported on Wednesday that three Indian planes went down, citing local government officials in India, this marks the first Western confirmation that Pakistan's Chinese-made jets were used in the shootdowns. Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told Reuters on Thursday that the J-10 was used to shoot down three French-made Rafale planes, which were newly acquired by India. Altogether, Pakistan says it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat. The Rafale and the model of the J-10 used by Pakistan are both considered generation 4.5 fighter jets, placing them at the leading edge of combat aircraft.

The decision affects O Level, IGCSE, and International AS & A Level exams for students at both Cambridge Direct and British Council schools. “This only applies to exams on Friday 9 May,” they said, adding that they will “update schools by the evening of Sunday 11 May” about exams planned for Monday. Officials are still expecting exams in other parts of Pakistan on May 9 to go ahead “if the security situation remains unchanged,” but any new developments will be shared. Both the educational organisations in the joint statement said their “priority is to support the safety of students and staff, and help students progress with their education.” They added: “Where exams are cancelled, we use our expertise and well-established processes to make sure we can award fair grades so that students can progress.” Students have been advised to follow only the official Cambridge and British Council Pakistan pages for updates. Private candidates can contact British Council Customer Services, while school students should contact their institutions directly. Earlier, the British Council called off all GCE, IGCSE, IELTS, and University of London exams scheduled for Thursday, May 8, afternoon session across all Lahore venues due to emerging security and safety concerns. “This decision has been made to prioritise the safety & security of candidates,” the Council said, urging students and parents to rely solely on official British Council platforms for the latest updates. The statement did not mention whether the exams would be rescheduled, but emphasised that all further announcements would be made through official channels. The development comes after India launched unprovoked strikes in Pakistan in the early hours of Wednesday, two weeks after it accused its neighbour of involvement in an attack in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK in which 26 people were killed. Islamabad had denied the accusation and vowed to retaliate against the missile strikes, also saying it shot down five Indian aircraft, 25 drones, and damaged multiple checkposts. As the tensions continue, authorities across the country are on high alert, with flights also being suspended intermittently."

In retaliation, the Pakistan armed forces shot down five Indian Air Force (IAF) jets, seven drones, destroyed a brigade headquarters and several checkposts along the Line of Control (LoC). In his statement, Erdogan also regretted that recent Indian strikes led to the martyrdom of numerous civilians in Pakistan. The Turkish leader also pointed out that he had held a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif a day earlier to discuss the situation. He praised Islamabad’s proposal for an independent international investigation into the recent terrorist attack in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), describing it as a “valuable” step. “Despite those who pour fuel on the fire,” Erdogan added, “Türkiye is doing everything it can to lower tensions and open channels for dialogue before the situation reaches a point of no return.” Erdogan's statement comes hours after Pakistan's civil and military leadership issued a warning that the country's retaliation to any Indian misadventure would be so decisive and resounding that the entire world would hear its echo, and no announcements would be needed.

According to the flight schedule, a total of 149 flights scheduled for today have been cancelled from various airports. Islamabad has seen the cancellation of 42 flights, Lahore 36, and Karachi 34. Additionally, 11 flights in Sialkot, eight in Multan, six in Faisalabad, eight in Peshawar, and four in Quetta have also been cancelled. Sources indicated that since the resumption of flight operations, only six flights have been able to operate from the Karachi airport. The airport closures a day ago had a widespread impact, affecting about 400 flights, with 130 cancellations and 24 flights being diverted to alternative airports. Passengers are advised to contact their respective airlines for the latest updates on their flight schedules. A day ago, flight schedule was badly disrupted as airports faced suspension of flight operations for several hours. The flight operations remained suspended for almost eight hours due to heightened tensions between Pakistan and India at the country’s major airports, including Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi. While operations have resumed at all airports across Pakistan, logistical and administrative challenges continue to impact flight schedules nationwide.

In a statement released by the Foreign Office on Friday, Islamabad said India's accusations were part of a ""reckless propaganda campaign"" designed to damage Pakistan’s image and stir up tensions in the region. ""The repeated pattern of levelling accusations against Pakistan without any credible investigation reflects a deliberate strategy to manufacture a pretext for aggression and to further destabilise the region,"" reads the FO statement. On May 8, India launched strikes on Pakistan and AJK in the dark hours — an assault that Islamabad called a ""blatant act of war"".

This development comes as Pakistan said that its pilots shot down five sophisticated Indian fighter aircraft in a significant and alarming escalation along the Pakistan-India frontier on Wednesday morning. While India has so far maintained official silence on the matter, offering neither confirmation nor denial of the Pakistani claims, the BBC's investigative unit, BBC Verify , has independently authenticated three separate videos that seem to show the aftermath of at least one aircraft crash. According to BBC Verify , all three clips are believed to have been filmed in the same field near Bhatinda. One video shows personnel identified as Indian troops collecting metal debris. Notably, among the wreckage are parts that bear a resemblance to the frame of an advanced French-made Rafale aircraft that was recently inducted into the IAF. Adding further intrigue, two additional night-time videos originating from the same location capture flaming debris and a projectile streaking across the night sky before impacting the ground and igniting a fire. Analysts suggest that these viral accounts are consistent with a mid-air strike or a dogfight scenario, lending credence to Pakistan's assertions of having successfully downed multiple Indian aircraft. According to TRT Global , Justin Crump, a former British Army officer and head of the security firm Sibylline, analysed the footage for the BBC . He said that the recovered fragments appear to include a French-made air-too-air missile, a type compatible with both the Rafale and Mirage 2000 jets, both of which are operated by the IAF. Additionally, an image that was widely circulating on social media, added to the visual evidence as it showed a tail fin bearing the markings ""BS001"" and ""Rafale"". The BBC's verification process, which included a reverse image search, indicates that the image is recent and not related to any prior incidents. The unfolding situation is drawing intense scrutiny from global military observers. The reported aerial encounters between Pakistan's advanced fighter jets and India's French-built fighters offer a rare glimpse into the real-world capabilities of modern combat aircraft, missile technology, and pilot performance under high-pressure conditions. Furthermore, two high-ranking US officials have reportedly told Reuters news agency that at least two Indian aircraft were brought down in the engagement. This development could potentially mark a significant milestone for Chinese jet technology, which has been exported to Pakistan. During a press conference held on Wednesday afternoon, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri notably refrained from either confirming or denying the reports of lost aircraft."

Speaking on Geo News ' morning show ""Geo Pakistan"", Chaudhry stressed the need for written guarantees to ensure such provocations are not repeated. “We must be firm that this biennial drama by India comes to an end,” he said, adding that India has repeatedly stirred tensions for political gains, particularly under the Modi administration, which he accused of fuelling hatred among the Indian public. Chaudhry noted that Pakistan had been provoked considerably this time, alleging that India not only sent drones across the border but also launched a disinformation campaign to claim that Pakistan had fired missiles first. “They accused us falsely of launching missiles and used that as a justification for sending drones,” said the former diplomat. “We did not resort to lies—we crafted our narrative with responsibility.” He called for the establishment of a joint commission between the two countries to probe such incidents and prevent future escalations. “If any such event occurs, there must be a mechanism—an SOP—that leads to a commission being formed immediately,” Chaudhry proposed. He also criticised Indian media for continuously spreading falsehoods, saying the disinformation had reached unprecedented levels. Commenting on India’s threat to block Pakistan’s water, Chaudhry termed it “unacceptable” and a clear violation of regional norms. “There has to be a guarantee, written and binding, that India will not take such actions again.” Chaudhry further said that if no assurance is secured on two key points — India’s war-mongering rhetoric and its aggressive tactics — then peace talks would hold little value. “If there’s no guarantee on these, I don’t see much benefit in pursuing peace talks,” he remarked."
"NA voices unity, backs army's response to Indian aggression","May 09, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603769-national-assembly-voices-unity-backs-armys-response-to-indian,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-09/603769_2541405_updates.jpg,"ISLAMABAD: In a show of national solidarity, the National Assembly has yet again expressed unanimous support for Pakistan's military response to India's recent acts of aggression. The lawmakers from various political parties rallied behind the armed forces, applauding their steadfast actions to defend the country's sovereignty. The latest escalation in the decades-old India-Pakistan rivalry began on May 7 when at least 31 civilians were killed in an unprovoked Indian cross-border attack. In retaliation, Pakistan downed its five fighter jets, including three Rafale, and dozens of drones. Meanwhile, India continues to send drones into Pakistani territory, with the military shooting down nearly 80, including Israeli-made IAI Heron — medium-altitude, long-endurance — unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, speaking in the assembly, commended the military's bold stance against India's provocations. ""We have effectively responded to India's aggressive designs, and our armed forces are battling bravely along the Line of Control (LoC), border, and working boundary,"" Asif said. He highlighted the significant achievements of Pakistan's military, such as the downing of five Indian fighter jets and the interception of a drone aimed at gathering intelligence on Pakistan's positions. Asif also reaffirmed the strategic support Pakistan has received from international allies, including China, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, who have stood by the country in this period of heightened tension. ""India's closest allies have distanced themselves, and our adversary has failed to garner broad international backing,"" Asif remarked. The defence minister also spoke about the strategic importance of maintaining national morale, noting that Pakistan's military is well-equipped and fully prepared for any escalation. ""Our forces are fighting valiantly and are 200% ready to confront any challenge,"" Asif said, urging the public to remain confident in the army's efforts. PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser emphasised national unity during his address in the National Assembly, stating: ""When Pakistan faces a challenge, the whole nation puts aside differences and stands united."" He reaffirmed PTI's role as a responsible political party and added: ""For the sake of unity, we supported the resolutions presented in the house."" Qaiser also highlighted the injustices faced by PTI members, referring to the mistreatment of party leadership and their imprisonment in Adiala Jail. ""We were subjected to ill-treatment, but we held back our anger when India launched an attack,"" he said. Criticising the government, Qaiser condemned the decision regarding military courts, which he believed was unconstitutional. ""Military courts should not be used for civilian trials,"" he said. He also expressed concern over the denial of a meeting between the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and the PTI founder, Imran Khan, despite a court order. He accused the government of dividing the nation instead of fostering unity, adding: ""The government has fragmented national unity."" Qaiser also condemned the ongoing crackdown on PTI workers, calling it an unlawful act against democracy. ""This is treason,"" he remarked. Qaiser called for the release of PTI's leadership, particularly Khan, who remains in jail. ""If anything happens to him, those responsible will be held accountable,"" he warned. He concluded by stressing that despite being in a state of war, the government should focus on national security rather than political persecution. Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the emir of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), announced that his party would observe Defence Day today in honour of Pakistan's defence. He said: ""On May 11, there will be a Million March in Peshawar, and on May 15, another Million March will be held in Quetta."" The rallies are expected to serve as a significant show of solidarity and unity among the people. Fazl further explained the party's efforts in supporting the country's defence, stating: ""The government called on the youth to enlist for civil defence; we have entrusted Ansar al-Islam with the responsibility of civilian defence."" He added that the youth of religious seminaries were fighting on the front lines of Pakistan's defence. ""Today, the youth from religious seminaries are on the first line of defence for Pakistan,"" he said. The JUI-F leader also touched upon the country's foreign policy concerns. ""We have no diplomatic mission abroad; all we have is communication over the phone,"" he said, expressing dissatisfaction with the current state of diplomatic activities. Fazl said that Pakistan should be engaging with countries like China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Afghanistan to strengthen its foreign relations. ""We should have engaged with China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Afghanistan,"" he said, adding that he was not content with the government's handling of diplomatic matters. He emphasised the importance of strengthening Pakistan's defence institutions during these challenging times. ""This is the time to fortify the country's defence institutions,"" he said. Fazl also pointed out that Pakistan is currently on the front lines in the face of Indian aggression. ""The reality is that Pakistan is on the front lines against Indian aggression,"" he remarked. He condemned India's actions, noting that Indian forces had launched rockets at mosques, seminaries, and civilian areas. ""Our brothers and sisters have been martyred,"" he added. Despite the challenges, he praised the Pakistan Army for its courageous and strategic defence efforts. ""The Pakistani army has defended the country with bravery and stunning strategies,"" he concluded. Federal Minister Rana Tanveer strongly condemned India's aggressive actions against Pakistan. ""India has launched aggression against Pakistan,"" he said, emphasising the self-made excuses used by India to link these actions with Pakistan. He said: ""India fabricated its reason [for attacks] and tried to connect it with Pakistan."" Tanveer asserted that Pakistan had successfully thwarted India's designs. ""Pakistan has crushed India's ambitions,"" he remarked. Reflecting on the situation in Kashmir, he noted, ""When India annexed Occupied Kashmir through constitutional amendments, we should have raised our voices at that moment."" He also said that India has aligned itself with Israel. ""India has formed an alliance with Israel,"" Tanveer said, condemning Israel's actions in Gaza. Tanveer suggested that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been misled by Israel. ""Modi has fallen into a trap with Israel's advice,"" he said, adding, ""Now, Modi has to deal with Pakistan."" Regarding the sentiments of the people, Tanveer shared: ""We are receiving calls from people who want to go to the border."" He expressed confidence in Pakistan's military capabilities, stating: ""Our forces are professional, and I know the modern defence equipment we possess."" He further praised Pakistan's military advancements, highlighting the superiority of the JF-17 Thunder fighter jet. ""The capability of the JF-17 Thunder is greater than the F-16,"" he said. Tanveer concluded with a warning to India, saying: ""I want to make India understand that it's not the gun but the people behind the gun that make a difference."" He also credited the Pakistan Air Force for its success in bringing down the Rafale fighter jet, stating, ""The credit for shooting down the Rafale goes to our Shaheens (the Pakistan Air Force)."""
"US VP Vance says war between India, Pakistan will be 'none of our business'","May 09, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603770-us-vp-vance-says-war-between-india-pakistan-will-be-none-of-our-business,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-09/603770_9538106_updates.jpg,"WASHINGTON: US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that India and Pakistan should de-escalate tensions, but he added that the US cannot control the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours and a war between them would be ""none of our business"". ""We want this thing to de-escalate as quickly as possible. We can't control these countries, though,"" Vance said in an interview on Fox News show ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"". ""What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we're not going to get involved in the middle of war that's fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America's ability to control it,"" he added. India is an important partner for Washington, which aims to counter China's rising influence, while Pakistan remains a US ally despite its diminished importance after Washington's withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021. Analysts and some former officials have said US involvement to achieve diplomatic goals in Russia's war in Ukraine and Israel's war in Gaza may make Washington leave India and Pakistan on their own in the early days of their tensions, without much direct pressure from the US government. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said further retaliation was ""increasingly certain,"" on the second day of major clashes on Thursday. Two days of fighting killed nearly four dozen people. The latest escalation in the decades-old India-Pakistan rivalry began on May 7 when at least 31 civilians were killed in unprovoked Indian cross border attack. In retaliation, Pakistan downed its five fighter jets, including three Rafale, and dozens of drones. India claimed it targeted terrorists hideouts inside Pakistan, in response to the April 22 militants attack that left 26 people in Illegally India Occupied Jammu and Kashmir dead that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad, which denied the accusations and called for a neutral probe. ""Our hope and our expectation is that this is not going to spiral into a broader regional war or, God forbid, a nuclear conflict,"" Vance said on Thursday. Washington has held regular talks with both in recent days, including on Thursday when Secretary of State Marco Rubio held calls with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the India's foreign minister while urging them to de-escalate and have direct dialogue. US President Donald Trump called rising tensions a shame. On Wednesday, he said he hoped the two countries will stop now after going ""tit-for-tat"". The State Department urged both countries to work towards what Washington terms as a ""responsible solution."""

Chairing a meeting on the preparation of the federal budget 2025-26, the premier said that all resources will be utilised to reduce the financial difficulties of the poor and middle class. The premier directed that the upcoming budget should be prepared with a focus on sustainable export-driven growth and giving due consideration to projects to promote industries and increase production. The budget should also focus extensively on the creation of jobs, agriculture, information technology, small and medium enterprises, and the housing sector, he added. The premier said that the government and the private sector must work together for national development and prosperity. Calling the public-private partnerships and youth vocational training among the government’s priorities, PM Shehbaz noted that positive results were emerging from the government’s power sector reforms, as the reduction in electricity prices for industries would help promote industry and production. He further said that automation and digitisation were being promoted to bring transparency in the government system and facilitate the business community and investors. He said that the government would continue the process of rightsizing to reduce the size of the federal government in the next fiscal year. During the briefing, the attendees were informed that consultations with the private sector on budget preparation had been in process for the past three months, besides consultative sessions with stakeholders from various sectors. The meeting was also informed that the five-year Trade Policy Framework for 2025-30 and the E-Commerce 2.0 Framework would be completed soon, and a plan for tariff rationalisation was also being prepared. The delegation of businessmen and experts expressed confidence in the government’s economic policies and presented their suggestions which the prime minister welcomed and directed the inclusion of feasible proposals in the budget."
How to spot fake news amid Pakistan-India tensions,"May 09, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603798-how-to-spot-fake-news-amid-pakistan-india-tensions,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-09/603798_8839639_updates.jpg,"Given the massive surge in misinformation circulating on social media amid the ongoing Pakistan-India tensions, Geo.tv reached out to the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF) to seek expert advice on how to educate viewers on identifying and avoiding fake news. Here’s the DRF-backed toolkit to spot propaganda and fake news. Pause before sharing: Don’t assume a high number of likes, comments or shares equals authenticity. Similarly, a WhatsApp message may not be credible if it has the label “Forwarded many times” on top. Does it provide a credible source? If there’s no link citing the source of the information, then it’s not credible. If there is a link provided, even then check whether it redirects to a credible source (containing information relevant to the topic and from an authoritative body). You can also gauge the credibility of the source from the URL and whether it is relevant to the information being shared, for example, the domain name may be: Investigate the source of the information: Cross-check any social media post that claims a piece of information (like notifications) is from a government body by going to the official website of that department, or by waiting to see if a news organisation reports on it. You can also call the relevant government authority directly on their listed phone number to verify! Are there any typographical errors? Spelling or grammatical mistakes can indicate that this information has not been vetted or has not been issued by a reliable source. Check the timeliness of the information: Ask yourself these questions: What is  the purpose  of sharing the information? To check whether the information being shared is correct and reliable, check whether the language or tone is free from bias (political, ideological, cultural, institutional or personal). Does the account holder sharing the information make their intention or purpose clear? Check the legitimacy of the account holder: Review the account holder’s account creation date, previous content shared, who they follow, and the quality of engagement. Check the Profile Photo and Username: Look at their Followers, Following, and Suggested Follows Posting habits : Note on ""Twitter-Verified"" Accounts: Twitter used to verify accounts for media organisations, non-profits, celebrities, and other public figures and outlets, so readers would know whether the account could be trusted. These accounts would be indicated by a Blue Checkmark, but the Blue Checkmark program is now part of the paid-level ""Twitter Blue"" service, or is on by default for accounts with over one million followers. Blue Checkmarks are no longer considered a reliable tool for account authentication. There are two other levels of verified accounts: Gold Checkmarks (official business account through Twitter Verified Organisations, which are also distinct via a square profile picture), and Grey Checkmarks (government/multilateral organisations or officials). Identifying Deepfakes: Recognising whether the video you see online  is real or not is getting more difficult by the day with the advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), but besides checking the source of the video, here are some quick tips to help you decipher whether a video may be a deepfake: 1) Audio-video sync: Does the sound match the lips? Check if the voice feels out of sync or the mouth moves weirdly. 2) Face and skin texture: Check the skin texture on the cheeks, forehead, and neck. Does the face match the person's age? 3) Blinking patterns: People blink naturally. Deepfakes might have too much or too little blinking or unnatural eye movements. 4) Glitches and flickers: Notice if certain areas, like hair or skin, flicker or blur during movement, especially in low-quality videos. 5) Lighting and shadows: Shadows should fall naturally on the face, under the chin, or on glasses. If the light doesn’t make sense, something’s fishy. Deepfakes often struggle to replicate natural lighting. 6) Facial features: Look at moles, facial hair, and eyebrows. Do they move naturally with the face? Are they consistent throughout the video? 7) Text distortions: Check if the text is readable. If it looks garbled or is not in a decipherable language, then it may be a deepfake. Deepfakes using voice cloning may struggle with regional dialects and pronunciation. Pakistani Urdu: Softer accent, Persianized vocabulary, and distinct fluency in delivery. Indian Urdu (especially Bollywood-style): Often mixed with Hindi, sharper consonants, and different word choice. Telltale signs: Mispronunciations of names, places (e.g., “Rawalpindi” pronounced with Indian intonation or “phir” with “fir”), or overuse of Hindi-origin words in a Pakistani context. Tip: Always cross-check suspicious videos with known speeches or interviews. If a public figure’s voice or dialect sounds “off,” especially in high-stakes political contexts, assume manipulation. Note: AI-generated content identifying tools are also available, but they are not always reliable and can be tricked. They have been known to give false positive or negative results. The best course of action is to always go back to the source. DRF conducts basic digital safety trainings to educate human rights activists and journalists around the country on how to secure their online presence, safe storage of information, communications security and tactics for prevention of cyber-harassment and to avoid digital surveillance."
"India's jingoism should be source of serious concern for world, warns Pakistan","May 09, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603793-indias-jingoism-should-be-source-of-serious-concern-for-world-warns-pakistan,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-09/603793_2765219_updates.jpg,"As India continued to provoke nuclear-armed Pakistan following the May 7 missile strikes, Islamabad on Friday warned that New Delhi’s “jingoism and war hysteria"" should be a cause of serious concern for the entire world. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: ""It is most unfortunate that India’s reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict."" India launched strikes on Pakistan and AJK early Wednesday morning — an assault that Islamabad called a ""blatant act of war"" — as tensions spiral between the nuclear-armed rivals after a deadly attack on tourists in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) last month. Islamabad said six Pakistani locations, from mosques to hydropower projects, were targeted. Pakistan charged India with bringing the nuclear-armed neighbours ""closer to a major conflict"", as the death toll from three days of missile, artillery and drone attacks passed 50. Speaking the media today, the FO spokesperson strongly condemned India’s aggression, calling it a violation of international law and a threat to regional peace. He said Indian strikes targeted civilians, mosques, and damaged infrastructure, including the Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project. India’s claims of targeting terrorist camps were rejected as false, with Pakistan reiterating its offer for a neutral international investigation into the Pahalgam incident. The FO said India failed to provide any evidence and had resorted to fabricated propaganda. Pakistan was exercising restraint but would act in defence if needed, the spokesperson said. Pakistani security and government officials said five civilians — including a two-year-old girl — were killed by Indian shelling overnight in areas along the Line of Control (LoC). ""In response, the Pakistan Army carried out a strong counterattack, targeting three Indian posts,"" police official Adeel Khan, told AFP from Kotli district, where four of the deaths occurred. Pakistani military sources, meanwhile, said that its forces had shot down 77 Indian drones in the last two days, claiming they were Israeli-made. ""The youth of Kashmir will never forget this act of brutality by India,"" said 15-year-old Muhammad Bilal in Muzaffarabad, the main city in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) where a mosque was hit in Wednesday’s strikes. Pakistan has rejected claims by New Delhi that it was behind last month’s attack in Pahalgam, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), when gunmen killed 26 people. On Friday, schools were closed in AJK, Punjab and IIOJK, affecting tens of millions of children. India has also closed 24 airports, but according to local media, the suspension on civilian flights may be lifted on Saturday morning. The conflict has caused major disruption to international aviation, with airlines having to cancel flights or use longer routes that don’t overfly the Indian-Pakistan frontier. The mega Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament was on Friday suspended for a week, the Indian cricket board announced, a day after a fixture was abandoned in Dharamsala, less than 200 kilometres (125 miles) from Jammu, where explosions had been reported. The Pakistan Super League, meanwhile, was moved to the United Arab Emirates, after an Indian drone struck Rawalpindi stadium on Thursday. American Vice President JD Vance has called for de-escalation, while underlining that Washington was ""not going to get involved in the middle of a war that’s fundamentally none of our business"". Several countries have offered to mediate, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in New Delhi on Thursday, days after visiting Pakistan. Diplomats and world leaders have pressured both countries for restraint. However, the International Crisis Group said ""foreign powers appear to have been somewhat indifferent"" to the prospect of war, despite warnings of possible escalation. ""A combination of bellicose rhetoric, domestic agitation and the remorseless logic of military one-upmanship have heightened the risks of escalation, particularly because for some time there was no diplomatic communication between the sides,"" it said. Amnesty said the warring sides ""must take all necessary measures to protect civilians and minimise any suffering and casualties"". — With additional input from AFP."

He stressed that India’s unprovoked and unjustified acts of aggression had violated Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and seriously endangered regional peace and stability. The prime minister paid tribute to the valiant armed forces of Pakistan, who had demonstrated exemplary commitment and courage in the defence of the nation against the enemy’s nefarious advances. He said Pakistan was fully determined to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.

In response to these provocations, DG ISPR assured that all assets of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) are secure. ""All our assets are safe, and we are fully prepared for any response,"" the DG ISPR stated, emphasizing that the Pakistani nation will not be intimidated by India's tactics. Lieutenant General Chaudhry further warned that India’s actions are part of a broader strategy to destabilize the region. “India’s deceit and aggression will not deter us. We are ready for whatever response is necessary,” he added. Pakistan has urged the international community to take notice of India’s hostile actions, which are heightening tensions not only between the two nations but also within the broader South Asian region. The military leadership has called on the world to hold India accountable for its provocations."

The statement came amid heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed states after New Delhi launched an unprovoked missile strike on cities in Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). ""New Delhi has moved its western fleet closer to the northern Arabian Sea, placing it within striking range of Karachi, Pakistan’s largest port,"" the Telegraph report claimed. The Indian strike group, the report claimed, comprises an aircraft carrier, destroyers, frigates and other assets and is roughly 300-400 miles from Pakistan's coast. Speaking on Geo News programme, Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath, Rear Admiral (retd) Faisal Shah said that the Indian Navy ship is in international waters — approximately 700km away from Pakistan. He stated that the BrahMos missile has a range of 450km, which means India would have to move 250km closer in order to launch it. He added that there is no free passage for the Indian Navy, ""as the Pakistan Navy is also standing ready"". Amid the ongoing tensions between the two countries, the former rear admiral said that the Indian Navy was expected to be at sea, and their current location is not surprising. The latest escalation in the decades-old Pakistan-India rivalry began on May 7 when at least 31 civilians were killed in an unprovoked Indian cross-border attack. In retaliation, Pakistan downed its five fighter jets, including three Rafale, and dozens of drones. Meanwhile, India continues to send drones into Pakistani territory, with the military shooting down nearly 80, including Israeli-made IAI Heron — medium-altitude, long-endurance — unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told media: ""We will not de-escalate — with the damages they did on our side, they should take a hit.""

Pakistan's foreign minister also said both countries had agreed to a ceasefire ""with immediate effect"" and India's foreign ministry said it would start at 5pm Indian time (1130 GMT). ""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. The sudden announcement came on a day when fears spiked that the countries' nuclear arsenals might come into play as Pakistan's military said a top military and civilian body overseeing its nuclear weapons would meet. But Pakistan's defence minister later said no such meeting was scheduled. At the same time, officials from both sides showed a willingness to take a step back following the day's exchanges, as the combined civilian death toll on the two sides rose to 66. ""Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect,"" Pakistani Foreign minister Ishaq Dar posted on X. ""Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity!"" India's foreign ministry said that the head of Pakistan's military operations called his Indian counterpart on Saturday afternoon and it was agreed that both sides would stop all firing. The two heads will speak to each other again on May 12, the ministry added. The fighting began on Wednesday when India carried out strikes on what it said was ""terrorist infrastructure"" in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Pakistan, two weeks after 26 people were killed in an attack on tourists in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). Pakistan denied India's accusations that it was involved in the tourist attack. Since Wednesday, the two countries have exchanged cross-border fire and shelling, and sent drones and missiles into each other's airspace. The countries have been locked in a dispute over Kashmir since they were born after the end of British colonial rule in 1947. They have gone to war three times since, including twice over Kashmir, and clashed several times. Pakistan's airspace has been fully restored for all types of flights, confirms a spokesperson of Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA). This development comes after US President Trump announced that India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire after Islamabad's offensive against New Delhi earlier today. All airports in the country are available for normal flight operations, the airport authority spokesperson said. He also said that passengers were requested to contact the relevant airline for the latest schedule of their flights. The restoration of Pakistan's airspace comes hours after its closure was extended till 12pm tomorrow, May 11, for all types of flights, earlier. The authority said that the airspace had been previously closed amid tensions between Pakistan and India at the Line of Control (LoC). Earlier today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir and urged both Pakistan and India to find ways to de-escalate, a US Department of State spokesperson said. Rubio also offered US assistance in starting constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts, the spokesperson said. Additionally, US Secretary of State Rubio also contacted Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, urging restraint amid the ongoing tensions with India. Geo News anchor Shahzeb Khanzada, citing sources, reported that Dar told his American counterpart Pakistan is ready to seek a resolution if India halts further action. However, he made it clear that if India continues its aggression, Pakistan will respond with even greater force. Shortly after India launched unprovoked missile attacks on Pakistani airbases amid heightened tensions in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, the Pakistan army last night launched ""Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos"" and hit several Indian military sites, security sources said. The latest escalation in the decades-old Pakistan-India rivalry began on May 7 when at least 31 civilians were killed in an unprovoked Indian cross-border attack. In retaliation, Pakistan downed five IAF fighter jets, including three Rafale, and dozens of drones. Shortly after the attack on the Pakistani airbases in the wee hours of Saturday, the Pakistan army launched its counter-attack in direct response to continuous provocations by India. Security sources initially told Geo News that at least 11 sites in India were targeted, including the key Pathankot air base, Udhampur air base, Gujarat air base, Rajasthan air base and BrahMos storage site. Furthermore, sources said that Pakistan targeted the Udhampur air base with a barrage of three missiles, which were the indigenously developed Fateh-1, with a range of 120kms. Meanwhile, the Pakistan armed forces also destroyed an Indian Army brigade headquarters and the supply depot at Uri. On the other hand, a cyberattack reportedly disabled 70% of India's power grid, security sources added. In another wave of strikes, the armed forces targeted and destroyed a second BrahMos storage site in Nagrota. An Indian Army artillery battery was also destroyed. In a major success for the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), hypersonic missiles fired by JF-17 Thunders destroyed India's S-400 system at Adampur airbase, security sources said. The airbase was also hit during the strike. The S-400 air defence system is worth around $1.5 billion, considered India’s most advanced air defense shield. In the later strikes, Pakistani armed forces also destroyed Bathinda, Halwara and Sirsa airfields, marking deeper penetration into Indian air defence zones. Additionally, several Indian military posts along the Line of Control (LoC) were struck, resulting in significant material losses. A strike on a high value Indian military intelligence centre in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) was also confirmed, further disrupting India’s operational capabilities in the region. Indian media also admitted Pakistani attacks on Indian air forces' bases in Pathankot, Poonch, and Jammu in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). The Indian army has said that Pakistan employed a high-speed missile to target an airbase in Indian Punjab. It also admitted that Pakistan attempted 26 aerial incursions into Indian territory, and that India suffered damage of equipment and personnel at Indian military bases. Moreover, security sources detailed the destruction of key enemy locations, including the Chhao Gali post in the Pandav sector and the Lal Jan post in the Lipa sector. Furthermore, sources indicate that the Salamabad post and the Sokajabra post were also targeted and destroyed by Pakistani forces. On the other hand, the Indian military said that Pakistan is increasing its deployment of troops along the border. As part of its ongoing retaliatory operations, Pakistan has launched a sweeping cyberattack, hacking into several high-profile Indian websites, security sources said. Among the targeted sites is the official website of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was taken down along with critical data. The attack also affected the websites of the Crime Research Investigation Agency, Mahanagar Telecommunication Corporation Limited (MTCL), and Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) — a key supplier of military equipment to the Indian armed forces. Additionally, the website of the All India Naval Technical Supervisory Staff Association was also breached, with hackers reportedly erasing its entire content. A Pakistani cyber attack team also reportedly hacked into the systems of India's Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL). According to sources familiar with the operation, the cyber assault led to a complete blackout across parts of the Maharashtra state, disrupting both commercial and domestic power supplies. The attack is said to have also wiped data records, including those related to electricity meters for homes and businesses throughout the region. The extent of the damage and the time required for system restoration remain unclear. On Friday night, India launched multiple missile attacks on Pakistani airbases, including the Nur Khan, Murid, and Shorkot airbases, which were fired from aircraft, according to Director General Inter-Services Public Relations Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry. He further said that India had also targeted Afghanistan with missiles and carried out a drone strike in the region. “India is aggressively pushing the entire region towards war with its reckless actions,” he said during a media briefing. DG ISPR assured that all assets of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) are secure. ""All our assets are safe, and we are fully prepared for any response,"" the DG ISPR added. The Group of Seven (G7) countries urged maximum restraint from both India and Pakistan and called on them to engage in direct dialogue amid rising hostilities. In a statement released by Canada, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, US, UK and the European Union said they ""strongly condemn"" a deadly attack on tourists in Indian Kashmir on April 22 and ""urge maximum restraint from both India and Pakistan."" ""We call for immediate de-escalation and encourage both countries to engage in direct dialogue towards a peaceful outcome,"" the G7 statement said. Locked in a longstanding dispute over Kashmir, the two nuclear-armed neighbors have engaged in daily clashes since Wednesday when India launched strikes inside Pakistan. India said the strikes were retaliation for the April 22 tourist attack that it blamed on Pakistan and for which Pakistan denies responsibility. Pakistan vowed to retaliate. Pakistan and India claim Kashmir in full but each controls only part. — With additional input from Reuters."
Pakistan shuts airspace for all flights amid clashes with India,"May 10, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603854-pakistan-shuts-airspace-for-all-flights-amid-clashes-with-india,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-10/603854_9841244_updates.jpg,"Pakistan has closed its airspace for all types of flights from 3.15am to 12pm on May 10 after India launched another wave of missiles targeting three air bases — including Nur Khan in Rawalpindi. Flight operations in the two countries have been facing intermittent interruptions after last month’s Pahalgam attack triggered tensions between the nuclear-armed countries. Foreign nationals at Jinnah International Airport in Karachi were shifted to hotels after the suspension of flight operations, sources said late Friday. Sources added that remaining passengers at the terminal were advised to return home. Travellers have been instructed to confirm the status of their flights with respective airlines before coming to the airport. Soon after India’s latest attack on Pakistani airbases, Islamabad launched the operation named ‘Bunyan-un-Marsoos’ against India and targeted several strategic installations, security sources said. At least 10 sites in India were targeted, including the key Pathankot air base, Udhampur air base, Gujarat air base. Rajhastan air base and Brahmos storage sites in Beas and Nagrota, security sources added. The operation was launched in retaliation for Indian missile strikes that hit several locations inside the country. Earlier late Friday, India had fired missiles at three air bases inside Pakistan, however, all assets of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) remained safe, a military spokesperson said. Director General Inter Service Public Relations (ISPR) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry at a press conference confirmed that India fired the air-to-ground missiles at the Nur Khan base (Rawalpindi), Murid base (Chakwal) and Shorkot air base. “By the grace of Allah Almighty, all PAF assets are safe,” he said. He warned India of a befitting response, saying “Now just wait for our response”. The DG ISPR said India also fired missiles and drones in Afghanistan. He said India, with its arrogance, was pushing the region into destabilisation. “We will not get impressed by this, and will fight with full force,” he added."
Pakistan army pays tribute to martyred children with Al-Fateh missile strike,"May 10, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603858-pakistan-army-pays-tribute-to-martyred-children-with-al-fateh-missile-strike,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-10/603858_6820400_updates.jpg,"The Pakistan Army on Saturday morning launched an Al-Fateh missile strike, paying tribute to the innocent children martyred during India's recent aggression in Pakistani territory. “Pakistan neither has forgotten nor will forget the sacrifices of these innocent souls,” the sources added. A picture released showed a banner on a launch vehicle with the names of the martyred children. The children were killed as a result of unprovoked Indian aggression targeting civilian areas. The latest escalation in the decades-old Pakistan-India rivalry began on May 7 when at least 31 civilians, including children, were killed in an unprovoked Indian cross-border attack. In retaliation, Pakistan downed five IAF fighter jets, including three Rafale, and dozens of drones. Meanwhile, India continued to send drones into Pakistani territory, with the military shooting down nearly 80, including Israeli-made IAI Heron — medium-altitude, long-endurance — unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Earlier on Friday night, India launched multiple missile attacks on Pakistani airbases, including the Noor Khan, Murid, and Shorkot airbases, which were fired from aircraft, according to Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR), Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry. He further said that India had also targeted Afghanistan with missiles and carried out a drone strike in the region. “India is aggressively pushing the entire region towards war with its reckless actions,” he said during a media briefing.

Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos — what does it mean?,"May 10, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603859-operation-bunyan-um-marsoos-what-does-it-mean,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-10/603859_1520077_updates.jpg,"In response to India's unprovoked attacks on Pakistani territory by India, the Pakistan Army has launched a military operation, named Bunyan-um-Marsoos, targeting multiple Indian military installations. Pakistan's offensive came shortly after it said India had fired missiles at three air bases earlier hours of Saturday — including one close to the capital, Islamabad, but Pakistani air defences intercepted most of them. Locked in a longstanding dispute over Kashmir, the two countries have engaged in daily clashes since Wednesday when India launched strikes inside Pakistan. Pakistan vowed to retaliate. The operation's name, Bunyan-um-Marsoos, is drawn from a verse of the Holy Quran, which means ""a wall constructed of molten lead"", symbolising strength, solidarity, and impenetrability. The Pakistan Army launched missile strikes against Indian military targets and paid tribute to the children martyred by India's cowardly missile strikes earlier. A banner on a launch vehicle displayed the names of the children."

Rubio also offered US assistance in starting constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts, the spokesperson said. Pakistan said it launched a military operation against India early on Saturday, targeting multiple military bases, including a missile storage site in northern India, as the neighbours extended their worst fighting in nearly three decades. The two South Asian countries have exchanged fire since Wednesday, when India launched air strikes in Pakistani territory after a deadly attack on tourists in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam — a tourist spot. The clashes — which have involved missiles, drones, and exchanges of fire along the Line of Control (LoC) — are the worst in decades and have killed more than 50 people. ""BrahMos storage site has been taken out in the general area Beas,"" the ISPR said, adding that the Pathankot airfield in India's western Punjab state and Udhampur Air Force Station in Indian Kashmir were also hit. Pakistan's information minister said in a post on the social media site X that the military operation was named ""Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos"". The term is taken from the Holy Quran and means a firm, united structure. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on local television that ""special measures"" had been taken to avoid civilian targets and that they were targeting locations that had been used to target Pakistan. Additionally, US Secretary of State Rubio also contacted Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, urging restraint amid the ongoing tensions with India. Geo News anchor Shahzeb Khanzada, citing sources, reported that Dar told his American counterpart Pakistan is ready to seek a resolution if India halts further action. However, he made it clear that if India continues its aggression, Pakistan will respond with even greater force. Ahead of the attack, DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry in a live broadcast in the middle of the night said India had ""attacked with missiles"" targeting three air bases. He said a ""majority of the missiles"" had been intercepted and ""no flying assets"" had been damaged. One of the bases targeted, Nur Khan air base in Rawalpindi, the garrison city where the army is headquartered, is around 10 kilometres (6 miles) from the capital Islamabad. Several blasts were heard from the capital overnight. The air base is used to receive foreign dignitaries, and Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir had departed just hours earlier. ""Now you just wait for our response,"" Chaudhry warned India."

Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday expressed hope that talks would take place with India after a global diplomatic push to ease tensions between the two nuclear neighbours following Islamabad's retaliation to New Delhi's aggression. In response to India's unprovoked attacks on Pakistani territory by India, the Pakistan Army has launched a military operation, named Bunyan-um-Marsoos, targeting multiple Indian military installations. Pakistan's offensive came shortly after it said India had fired missiles at three air bases earlier hours of Saturday — including one close to the capital, Islamabad, but Pakistani air defences intercepted most of them. ""India should stop if there's an iota of sanity. If they stop, so will we. We do not want destruction and waste of funds. You know, both economies are different, but we generally want peace, without the hegemony of any country,"" Dar told Geo News . ""My recent interactions have been very positive, and I believe that the way for talks will be open now,"" he added. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Pakistan's Army Chief Asim Munir on Friday morning, according to the US State Department. ""He continued to urge both parties to find ways to de-escalate and offered US assistance in starting constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts,"" said State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce. The Group of Seven countries on Friday urged maximum restraint and called on the two countries to engage in direct dialogue. China also expressed ""deep concern"" on Saturday over the escalating situation between India and Pakistan and offered to play a constructive role in resolving the matter, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry. Hours earlier, the DPM had asserted that ""victory will be ours"" after Pakistan launched a military operation in response to escalating Indian aggression. Dar, a seasoned politician, clarified that the action taken by Pakistan was defensive in nature and fully justified. Dar said that Pakistan has shot down 80 Indian drones and that 35 Pakistani citizens have been martyred in Indian strikes. He further confirmed that India carried out attacks on key Pakistani airbases including Noor Khan, Shorkot, and Sukkur. “This is not an offensive war,” Dar said. “Pakistan is responding to continuous Indian hostility. While we speak of peace, India acts otherwise,"" the foreign minister said. He accused India of making baseless claims, especially following the Pahalgam incident, and pointed out that New Delhi has failed to present any concrete evidence. “They shut the border, expelled our diplomats, and made wild accusations — all of which remain unproven.” Dar maintained that Pakistan has exercised restraint, targeting only those who directly launched payloads against its territory. “Our operation is precise. The world is watching and understands that we are acting in self-defence.” He added that Pakistan’s military had been prepared from day one, and no risks could be taken in light of India’s covert missile and drone strikes. “We cannot sit idle while they violate our sovereignty,” he said. Dismissing India’s claims of hitting 15 targets and projecting nuclear superiority, Dar remarked, “Their lies in the past 48 hours have been non-stop. Their narrative won’t hold.” He concluded by saying: “The responsibility is now on the world to make India realise its grave mistake. Our actions are proportionate and within our rights. Victory will be Pakistan’s.” Meanwhile, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal has hoped that India will not de-escalate to move to dialogue and diplomacy. ""We would hate to see the nuclear threshold being breached,"" he told Reuters."
"Indian military's backbone S-400 defence system, which Pakistan destroyed, explained","May 10, 2025",https://www.geo.tv/latest/603860-indias,https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/100x75.png,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-05-10/603860_205649_updates.jpg,"The Pakistan Army announced the successful destruction of an Indian S-400 air defence system in Adampur, soon after launching a military operation, named Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos, against India on Saturday. The S-400 air defence system, which is worth $1.5 billion, was destroyed using hypersonic missiles, launched from JF-17 Thunder aircraft, security sources said. The S-400 air defence system is a Russian-made missile defence system which is widely regarded as one of the world's most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems. According to NDTV , this system is designed to intercept a variety of aerial threats, including aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. This air defence system comprises three components — missile launchers, a powerful radar, and a command centre — and is capable of engaging aircraft, cruise missiles, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Additionally, the S-400 air defence system can target up to 600 kilometres away and engage almost all modern warplanes. In October 2018, India signed a $5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, which are viewed as a major threat by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) due to their long-range capabilities. The destruction of the air defence system came as part of Pakistan's broader military operation that was launched in response to Indian missile strikes on multiple air bases."

So far, no immediate reports of casualties or damage have been received. According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the earthquake struck at 10:08am PST. Its epicentre was located in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan at a depth of 230 kilometres. Coordinates were recorded at latitude 36.63 N and longitude 71.13 E. Seismic activity was reported in Peshawar, Mardan, Swat, Nowshera, Swabi, Attock, and North Waziristan, among other locations. Residents in these areas and surrounding areas reported noticeable tremors. The seismic activity comes nearly a month after two earthquakes hit several cities across KP, Azad Kashmir, Punjab, and parts of Afghanistan. The first earthquake, measuring a magnitude of 5.5, hit several cities across northern Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi on April 12, at a reported depth of 12 kilometres. Cities of Punjab, including Attock and Chakwal, also reported tremors in the region. In KP, jolts were felt in Peshawar, Mardan, Mohmand, Swabi, Nowshera, Lakki Marwat, Lower Dir, Malakand, Shabqadar and other cities. Days later, on April 16, a 5.3-magnitude earthquake hit several areas of KP, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Punjab, and parts of Afghanistan. Tremors for this earthquake were reported in the KP areas of Malakand, Swat, Shangla, Chitral, Abbottabad, Mardan, Mohmand, Swabi, and Lower Dir. Earthquakes are not uncommon in Pakistan, as the country is situated on the boundary of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Large parts of South Asia are seismically active as the Indian plate is pushing north into the Eurasian plate."

""This thing that you have spoken about (nuclear option) is present, but let's not talk about it — we should treat it as a very distant possibility, we shouldn't even discuss it in the immediate context,"" Asif told Geo News. ""Before we get to that point, I think temperatures will come down. No meeting has happened of the National Command Authority, nor is any such meeting scheduled."" This is worst fighting between the nuclear-armed rivals since 1999 has killed dozens of people on both sides and led to repeated calls for de-escalation from the United States and the G7 group of rich countries. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Army Chief General Asim Munir and India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, urging both sides to de-escalate and ""re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation"". ""India's approach has always been measured and responsible and remains so,"" Jaishankar said on X after the call with Rubio. Pakistan's foreign minister, Mohammad Ishaq Dar, told local television that if India stops here then ""we will consider to stop here"". Indian media reported that Indian and Pakistani officials had spoken on Saturday. The Indian military said regarding Pakistan's military attacks on Saturday that ""all hostile actions have been effectively countered and responded appropriately"". ""The Pakistan military has been observed to be moving their troops into forward areas, indicating offensive intent to further escalate the situation,"" Indian Wing Commander Vyomika Singh told a press conference. Pakistan early on Saturday said it had targeted multiple bases in India including a missile storage site in India's north, in response to prior attacks by the Indian military. India said there was limited damage to equipment and personnel at air force stations at the Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj areas. The military said there were several high-speed missile attacks on several air bases in Punjab, and that India had responded to the attacks. Five civilians were killed in the attacks in the Jammu region of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, regional police said. Pakistan said that, before its offensive, India had fired missiles at three air bases, including one close to the capital, Islamabad, but Pakistani air defences intercepted most of them. Analysts and diplomats have long feared that conflict between the arch-rivals could escalate into the use of nuclear weapons, in one of the world's most dangerous and most populated nuclear flashpoint regions. Locked in a longstanding dispute over Kashmir, the two countries have engaged in daily clashes since Wednesday when India launched strikes inside Pakistan on what it called ""terrorist infrastructure"". Pakistan vowed to retaliate. Information Minister Ataullah Tarar said in a post on X that Saturday's military operation was named ""Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos"". The term is taken from the Quran and means a firm, united structure. Sounds of explosions were reported in Srinagar and Jammu (IIOJK), where sirens sounded, a Reuters witness said. ""India through its planes launched air-to-surface missiles ... Nur Khan base, Mureed base and Shorkot base were made targets,"" Military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said in a late-night televised statement. India has said its strikes on Wednesday, which started the latest clashes between the countries, were in retaliation for a deadly attack on Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir last month. Pakistan denied India's accusations that it was involved in the tourist attack. Since Wednesday, the two countries have exchanged cross-border fire and shelling, and sent drones and missiles into each other's airspace."

According to Geo News , the prime minister contacted Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI)'s Emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, Balochistan Awami Party’s Khalid Magsi, and Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q)’s Chaudhry Salik Hussain. PM Shehbaz took them into confidence regarding the retaliatory measures taken by Pakistan following a series of Indian missile and drone strikes that he said targeted innocent civilians and critical installations, including Noor Khan Airbase. He said that despite repeated provocations, Pakistan acted with great restraint, but today delivered a “powerful and coordinated response” through its armed forces. ""Alhamdulillah, Pakistan’s armed forces gave a befitting reply in a well-coordinated manner,"" he said. The prime minister stated that the Indian side refused to accept a proposal for an impartial investigation into the Pahalgam incident, choosing instead to escalate hostilities. “This morning again, India launched missile attacks on Noor Khan Airbase and other locations,” he said, adding that innocent civilians had been deliberately targeted. In his message to the nation and political leadership, the prime minister said: “Today, we have avenged the blood of innocent citizens with a crushing response to India. I congratulate the entire nation and our political leadership on the success of this operation. We are proud of our armed forces.”"

The strikes, described by officials as “precise and proportionate”, were carried out in response to India’s continued aggression across the Line of Control (LoC) and within Pakistan’s sovereignty. This follows India’s missile attacks in multiple Pakistani cities during the night of May 5 and 6, which New Delhi claimed were aimed at ""terrorist targets"" in response to last month’s Pahalgam attack in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). However, the strikes resulted in civilian casualties in Pakistan, prompting a strong response. Top officials directly linked with the operation against India told Geo News that the following high-value Indian military targets were hit. Beas: A BrahMos missile storage facility was successfully hit and destroyed. Udhampur: Air Defence systems were struck and completely destroyed. The Udhampur Air Base sustained heavy structural damage. Pathankot: The military airfield was hit in a precision missile attack. Jalandhar: The Jalandhar Airbase was struck in ongoing operations. Gujarat: Multiple air bases and military installations were targeted. Delhi region: A missile was reportedly intercepted near Hisar. Delhi is being closely monitored as a potential future target. Rajasthan: Key military installations were struck, with damage assessments ongoing. Srinagar: The airbase in Srinagar was targeted; initial reports confirm at least 20 Indian military casualties. Chandigarh: A major weapons depot was hit and neutralised, according to confirmed intelligence sources. Adampur Air Base: S-400 air defence system has been destroyed by Pakistan. Sirsa: The Airfield in the Sirsa city has also been hit. Uri: Indian Army Brigade Headquarters and supply depot has been hit in Uri. Dehrangyari: Indian Artillery Position has been hit in Dehrangyari. Rajouri: Military intelligence training facility in Rajouri destroyed. Halwara: The Halwara Air Force Station has also been hit. LOC: Several Indian posts along the Line of Control (LoC) have been hit. IIOJK: Indian intel centre in IIOJK has been hit. Bathinda Airfield was hit as well. Strategic impact Senior Pakistani military officials, speaking on background, stated that the strikes were carried out under the operational framework of “measured retaliation” aimed at degrading India’s offensive capabilities while avoiding civilian targets. “Pakistan reserves the right to defend its sovereignty under international law,” a senior official said. “All strikes were carefully selected to target military infrastructure directly contributing to Indian aggression.” The operation has reportedly caused widespread disruption to Indian air defence operations across the northern sector. Satellite imagery and real-time surveillance indicate significant damage to assets and installations. Cyberattacks In a simultaneous digital offensive, Pakistan is also reported to have launched a major cyberattack on Indian infrastructure: Pakistan’s military action under ""Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos"" marks one of the most significant escalations between the nuclear armed arch-rivals in recent years. Islamabad has made it clear that while it is open to de-escalation, the responsibility lies with India to cease hostilities. Pakistan’s response was described by officials as “measured but resolute.” Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is expected to brief foreign ambassadors on the escalation. Meanwhile, the Indian government has not yet issued an official statement on the reported damage, though state-run media has acknowledged “ongoing hostilities” and “casualties”. The United Nations, United States, and China are closely monitoring the situation, with calls emerging for immediate de-escalation."

The offer, seen as a potential turning point, has received widespread appreciation from political analysts, who believe it signals a significant shift in international attention towards the region's most volatile dispute. Pakistan also appreciated the US president’s willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the longstanding Kashmir dispute that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond. ""We acknowledge with appreciation the constructive role played by the United States, alongside other friendly states, in supporting the recent ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India; a step towards de-escalation and regional stability,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement issued here. Earlier, President Trump wrote on his Truth Social wall, a social media platform saying: “I am very proud of the strong and unwaveringly powerful leadership of India and Pakistan for having the strength, wisdom, and fortitude to fully know and understand that it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much. Millions of good and innocent people could have died! Your legacy is greatly enhanced by your brave actions. I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision."" He further said in his post: ""While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great Nations. Additionally, I will work with you both to see if, after a “thousand years,” a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir. God bless the leadership of India and Pakistan on a job well done!"" Pakistan, the FO said, reaffirms that any just and lasting settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute must be in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and must ensure the realisation of the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, including their inalienable right to self-determination. Pakistan remains committed to engaging with the United States and the international community in efforts to promote peace, security and prosperity in the region. ""We also look forward to deepening our multifaceted partnership with the United States, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, and economic cooperation,"" the Foreign Office statement added. The development has come after the US facilitated a ceasefire between the neighbouring nuclear-armed countries, days after an intense military battle. Former Pakistani high commissioner to India Abdul Basit said President Trump's understanding of the root cause of the conflict is commendable. ""Trump should be appreciated for understanding that the root cause of Pakistan-India hostility is Jammu and Kashmir dispute,"" he said. ""Can he help, I don't know but diplomacy is the art of the possible provided you do it right. Kashmir can win him a Nobel."" International relations expert and political analyst Huma Baqai echoed this sentiment, emphasising the significance of Trump's mention of Kashmir. ""Donald Trump[']s tweet is a breath of fresh air, Mentioning Kashmir, is validation of Pakistan’s point of view and acknowledgement of Kashmir's disputed status, the cherry on the cake is trade. Thank you USA,"" she wrote on X. Michael Kugelman, a prominent South Asia expert, praised Trump's offer, particularly his focus on finding a Kashmir ""solution"". ""Trump has posted again about India and Pakistan — and this time he says he will work with them to seek a ""solution"" on Kashmir. Wow,"" Kugelman stated. He noted that the fresh offer made by Trump on Kashmir is a step forward from his previous offers. During his first term in the presidency, he offered of mediation on Kashmir provided that both sides agreed for it, he maintained. Veteran journalist Hamid Mir applauded Trump for reminding the international community about the significance of resolving the Kashmir issue for regional peace. ""Thank you Donald Trump for reminding the international community about KASHMIR Solution of this dispute will definitely bring peace in South Asia."" Senator Sherry Rehman described Trump's offer as a ""huge legacy win"", if he succeeds in bringing all parties to the negotiating table. ""President Donald Trump's X post again on the Pakistan and India ceasefire suggests he is looking to solve the longest dispute on the UN docket which is Kashmir. Peace and its dividends have been a distant dream for one-fifth of humanity in South Asia. ""If he is able to bring all parties to the table and craft a path forward, then it will indeed be a huge legacy win for him. And for all. So thank you for raising the issue."" These comments demonstrate Pakistan’s desire for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing conflict and its willingness to engage in constructive dialogue with India, facilitated by international mediation. However, the success of Trump's offer hinges on India's willingness to participate in such a process."
